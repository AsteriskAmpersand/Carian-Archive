<p>[121000] Multiplayer Password Setting</p>
<p>[121001] Group Password Setting</p>
<p>[121010] If you set a multiplayer password, you'll only be matched with other players using the same password for most multiplayer features.</p>
<p>However, multiplayer passwords do not apply to invasion or support multiplayer.</p>
<p>[121011] If you set a group password, you'll be more likely to see messages, summon signs, bloodstains, phantoms, and so on from others using the same password.</p>
<p>Elements given this special priority will appear differently from others.</p>
<p>[121100] With a Furlcalling Finger Remedy, you can see summon signs, which can be used to summon players from other worlds.
(Finger Remedies are consumed with use.)</p>
<p>There are various types of summon signs.
Gold signs summon Furled Finger cooperators.
Red signs summon duelist adversaries.
(For either type of multiplayer, the summoning player becomes Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>[121102] You can leave a gold summon sign to play cooperative multiplayer.</p>
<p>This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a Furled Finger for cooperative multiplayer.
Multiplayer begins once you are summoned.
(Your objective will be to defeat the area boss.)</p>
<p>If you leave a second summon sign, the older sign will vanish.</p>
<p>[121104] You can leave a red summon sign to play competitive multiplayer.</p>
<p>This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a duelist adversary for competitive multiplayer.
Multiplayer begins once you are summoned.
(Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>If you leave a second summon sign, the older sign will vanish.</p>
<p>[121106] Attempt to invade another player's world as a Bloody Finger.</p>
<p>If you successfully invade, invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)</p>
<p>[121107] Cancel invasion of other world</p>
<p>[121108] Choose a summoned player to
send back to their own world.</p>
<p>This player will be removed
from the multiplayer session.</p>
<p>[121109] Removed from multiplayer session.
Returning to own world.</p>
<p>[121110] Lures in invaders.</p>
<p>This allows your world to be invaded without any Furled Finger cooperators present, and it also shortens the interval between windows of opportunity for invasion.</p>
<p>Additionally, enables the arrival of a second invader to join when a cooperator is present. (With two invaders, the maximum number of cooperators becomes one.)</p>
<p>[121111] Stop beckoning invaders to your world</p>
<p>[121112] Puts you into a ready state to answer, should
someone in another world call for rescue.
You will be summoned to their world as a hunter.</p>
<p>Multiplayer will begin once you are summoned.
(Your objective will be to defeat invaders.)</p>
<p>[121113] Stop accepting summons requests</p>
<p>[121114] Allows you to automatically request for a hunter from another world to come to your rescue when your world is invaded.</p>
<p>You can also use this after being invaded to summon a hunter for help.
(Summoning rescuers may not always be possible.)</p>
<p>[121115] Cancel summons request</p>
<p>[121116] Send a cooperative summon sign to several nearby summoning pools (activated pools only).</p>
<p>If you are summoned, you will be transported to that summoning pool's location in the host player's world and multiplayer will begin.
(Your objective will be to help the host player defeat the area boss.)</p>
<p>[121117] Remove co-op summon sign from summoning pool</p>
<p>[121118] Send a competitive summon sign to several nearby summoning pools (activated pools only).</p>
<p>If you are summoned, you will be transported to that summoning pool's location in the host player's world and multiplayer will begin.
(Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>[121119] Remove hostile summon sign from summoning pool</p>
<p>[121120] Attempt to invade another player's world as a Bloody Finger.</p>
<p>If you successfully invade, your Festering Bloody Finger will be spent and invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)</p>
<p>[121121] Stop invading another world</p>
<p>[121122] Attempt to invade another player's world as a recusant.</p>
<p>If you successfully invade, invasion multiplayer will begin. (Your objective will be to defeat the Host of Fingers.)</p>
<p>You can attempt another invasion of the same world by using a Phantom Finger item. (These items are consumed upon use.)</p>

<h3>Dying and Dropping Runes [50]</h3>
<p>Upon dying, you will drop any runes in your possession at the site of your death.
You can reclaim those runes by reaching that same spot again.
However, if you die again before reclaiming those dropped runes, they will be lost forever.</p>
<h3>Summoning Spirits [52]</h3>
<p>When the monument icon is shown on the left side of the screen, you can summon spirits from ashes.
There are several different types of spirits that can be summoned.
Summoning spirits typically consumes FP.</p>
<h3>Resting at Sites of Grace [53]</h3>
<p>Resting at a site of grace will restore your HP, FP, and cleanse any status ailments.
It will also refill your sacred flasks.</p>
<p>However, most of the enemies you've defeated will be revived.</p>
<h3>Finding Sites of Grace [54]</h3>
<p>Sites of grace that you haven't discovered yet illuminate their surroundings.
If you see light while exploring, seek it out—you might find a site of grace.</p>
<h3>Guidance of Grace [55]</h3>

Even now, some sites of grace retain that power.
Their golden rays will guide you along your way.</p>
<h3>Sacred Flasks [56]</h3>
<p>The Flask of Crimson Tears replenishes your HP.
The Flask of Cerulean Tears replenishes your FP.</p>
<p>At sites of grace, you can allocate portions of doses to each flask.
You can also use certain items to upgrade your flasks at sites of grace.</p>
<h3>Fast Travel to Sites of Grace [57]</h3>
<p>Through your map, you can instantly travel to any sites of grace that you've discovered.
However, there are some dungeons and other areas where this cannot be done.</p>
<h3>Mounted Attacks [58]</h3>
<p>While on horseback, you can attack with armaments equipped in your right hand or in both hands.
If you take a certain amount of damage while on horseback, you will fall from your horse.
This will leave you greatly vulnerable.</p>
<h3>No-Riding Areas [59]</h3>
<p>You cannot enter large buildings, caves, catacombs, or similar spaces while on horseback.
You also cannot summon your horse while inside such spaces.</p>
<h3>Item Crafting [60]</h3>
<p>If you have a Crafting Kit, you can make various items from materials that you find.
Select "Item Crafting" from the main menu to make items.</p>
<?keyicon@28?>
<p>: </p>
<h3>Container Items [61]</h3>
<p>You will need cracked pots or other containers to craft certain items.
Container items will run out with use, but the containers themselves will remain.</p>
<h3>Armament Customization [62]</h3>
<p>Ashes of War are memories of the affinities and skills imbued in armaments wielded long ago.
With a Whetstone Knife, you can use Ashes of War to customize your armaments at sites of grace.</p>
<h3>Equip Load [65]</h3>
<p>When you carry more than 70% of your maximum equipment load, your dodge rolling will become slower and clumsier.
If you exceed your maximum equipment load entirely, you will be unable to roll at all.</p>
<h3>While in Combat [66]</h3>
<p>While in combat, you are unable to craft items or open your map.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Spirits [67]</h3>
<p>Spirits that you've summoned from ashes can be made more powerful by a spirit tuner.
You'll need glovewort to upgrade spirits.</p>
<h3>Leveling Up [68]</h3>
<p>When you level up, you can spend runes to increase your attributes.
As your attributes increase, your level rises—and so does the amount of runes required for your next attribute increase.</p>
<h3>Status: Poison [70]</h3>
<p>When the poison gauge is full, you will become poisoned and take continuous damage.
The higher your immunity, the longer it takes for the poison gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Scarlet Rot [71]</h3>
<p>When the scarlet rot gauge is full, you will become sick and take continuous damage.
The scarlet rot is a very dangerous status ailment, but the higher your immunity, the longer it takes for the gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Blood Loss [72]</h3>
<p>When the blood loss gauge is full, you will hemorrhage blood.
This causes a large amount of damage relative to your maximum HP.
The higher your robustness, the longer it takes for the blood loss gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Frost/Frostbite [73]</h3>
<p>When the frost gauge is full, you will take damage and become frostbitten for a while.
While suffering from frostbite, you will take increased damage from other sources.
The higher your robustness, the longer it takes for the frost gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Sleep [74]</h3>
<p>When the sleep gauge is full, you will become drowsy.
Weaker characters will fall asleep entirely.
The higher your focus, the longer it takes for the sleep gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Madness [75]</h3>
<p>When the madness gauge is full, you will go mad and lose a great deal of both HP and FP.
Only humans can be afflicted with madness.
The higher your focus, the longer it takes for the madness gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Status: Death [76]</h3>
<p>When your death gauge is full, you will be struck with instant death.
This is a very dangerous status ailment, but the higher your resistance to death, the longer it takes for the death gauge to fill.</p>
<h3>Poise [77]</h3>
<p>Heavy armor provides high poise, making you less likely to recoil from enemy attacks.
Wielding a heavy weapon with two hands may also provide similar effects.</p>
<h3>Cooperator's Objective (Furled Finger) [100]</h3>

<p>During competitive multiplayer, a duelist's objective is to defeat the Host of Fingers.

This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a Furled Finger for cooperative multiplayer.</p>
<h3>Leaving Hostile Signs [105]</h3>
<p>With a Duelist's Furled Finger, you can leave a red summon sign.
This sign will appear in other players' worlds and allow them to summon you as a duelist adversary for competitive multiplayer.</p>
<h3>Invasion [106]</h3>
<p>With a Festering Bloody Finger, you can enter another player's world as an invading Bloody Finger.
There are other items that allow you to invade other worlds as well.</p>
<h3>Requesting Support [107]</h3>
<p>If you use a White Cipher Ring, you will automatically request for a hunter from another world to come to your rescue when your world is invaded.
(Summoning is not always possible.)</p>
<h3>Supporting [108]</h3>
<p>If you use a Blue Cipher Ring, you will make yourself open to summons for rescue from other worlds. You will be summoned to their world as a hunter.</p>
<h3>Summoning Pools [109]</h3>
<p>In each area, you may find effigies of martyrs.
These effigies are summoning pools.</p>
<p>Summon signs made with small effigies are gathered at these summoning pools.
You'll find it easy to summon other players at these locations.</p>
<h3>Group Passwords [110]</h3>
<p>If you set a group password, you'll be more likely to see messages, summon signs, bloodstains, and phantoms from other players using the same password.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer Passwords [111]</h3>
<p>If you set a multiplayer password, you'll only be matched with other players using the same password for most multiplayer features.</p>
<p>However, multiplayer passwords do not apply to invasion multiplayer.</p>
<h3>Messages [112]</h3>
<p>You can use the Messages menu to leave messages for other players.</p>
<p>Your message will appear in other players' worlds at the spot where you stood when you wrote it.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer Movement Limits [113]</h3>
<p>During multiplayer, you can only explore a limited area.
Areas beyond those limits are blocked off with a wall of light.
They will be accessible again after multiplayer ends.</p>
<h3>Phantoms [114]</h3>
<p>You may occasionally see faint, white phantoms.
These are traces of players in other worlds and the actions they recently performed.</p>
<h3>Bloodstains [115]</h3>
<p>Bloodstains are left behind in spots where players in other worlds have died.
You can examine them to see how those players died.</p>

<h3>Invader Objective [119]</h3>
<p>During invasion multiplayer, the invader's objective is to defeat the Host of Fingers.
An invader will return to their own world when they die or the Host of Fingers is defeated, whichever happens first.</p>
<h3>Limits of Guarding [150]</h3>
<p>Attacks with certain affinities, such as fire or lightning, may make guarding less effective than it is against normal physical attacks.</p>
<p>Guarding does not work against many grappling attacks.</p>
<h3>Stance-Breaking [151]</h3>
<p>Some attacks may break an enemy's stance, giving you a chance to perform a critical hit.
Charge attacks and jump attacks make it particularly easy to break an enemy's stance.</p>
<h3>Knocking Down Mounted Enemies [152]</h3>
<p>Repeatedly attack a mounted enemy to knock them off of their mount and break their stance.
This will give you a chance to perform a critical hit.
Charge attacks and jump attacks are particularly likely to knock enemies off of their mounts.</p>
<h3>Hardened Foes [153]</h3>
<p>The slashing attacks of sharp weapons are largely ineffective against hardened armor and scales. Strike attacks are likely to hit the mark.</p>
<h3>Teardrop Scarabs [200]</h3>
<p>There are both Crimson and Cerulean Teardrop Scarabs.
Defeat them to replenish the flasks that match their type.
However, you cannot replenish more flasks than your maximum amount allows.</p>

[20230200] Become my blade, once more.<br />
[20230300]  <br />
[20230400]  <br />
[20230500] <long exhalation>  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[20240100] Ahh, art thou come to be born anew?<br />
[20240200] Be not afraid, there is no pain...<br />
[20240300] <children giggling>  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[20245100] Hush, little culver.<br />
[20245101] Hush, fair maid.<br />
[20245200] I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[20250000] Ahh, my beloved...<br />
[20250100] Have no fear, I will hold thee. Patience...<br />
[20250200] Ye will be countless born, forever and ever.<br />
[20250210] Ye will be countless, born, forever.<br />
[20250300] Defiler of mother's rich slumber.<br />
[20250400] Upon my name as Ranni the
Witch, thou wilt not go
unpunished.<br />
[20250500] After death, quite the tale will be
thine to tell.<br />
[20250600] Of the last Queen of Caria,
Rennala of the Full Moon.<br />
[20250700] And the majesty of the night
she conjureth.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[20255000] Ahh, my sweet children...<br />
[20255100] Have no fear, I will hold thee. Patience...<br />
[20255200] Ye will be countless born, forever and ever.<br />
[20255300] Upon my name as Ranni the Witch.<br />
[20255410] Mother's rich slumber shall not be
disturbed by thee.<br />
[20255500] Foul trespasser.<br />
[20255600] Send word far and wide.<br />
[20255700] Of the last Queen of Caria,
Rennala of the Full Moon.<br />
[20255800] And the majesty of the night
she conjureth.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[20260000] I dreamt for so long.<br />
[20260100] My flesh was dull gold...and my blood, rotted.<br />
[20260200] Corpse after corpse, left in my wake...<br />
[20260300] As I awaited...his return.<br />
[20260400] ...Heed my words.<br />
[20260500] I am Malenia.
Blade of Miquella.<br />
[20260600] And I have never known defeat.  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[20265000] Sweet Tarnished...<br />
[20265010] Dearest companion...<br />
[20265100] Did you not heed my warning?<br />
[20265200] Your greed knows no end.<br />
[20265300] You would steal the last drop of warmth from his empty frame?<br />
[20265310] After all you've taken, you still want more?<br />
[20265400] Then you will have to kill me.<br />
[20265500] I am Malenia, Sword of Miquella.<br />
[20265600] And I have never known defeat.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[20270000] My dear twin, accept this gift.<br />
[20270100] A gift of abundance, my last drop of dew.<br />
[20270200] Let all things flourish,<br />
[20270300] whether graceful, or malign.  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[20275000] Wait.<br />
[20275100] The scarlet bloom flowers once more.<br />
[20275200] You will witness true horror.<br />
[20275300] Now, rot!  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[20290000] Farewell, then.<br />
[20290100] May your visit be fruitful.  </p>
<h3>0203</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[20300000] Hmm...<br />
[20300100] Very well.<br />
[20300200] You...<br />
[20300300] A fitting sacrifice you shall be, for the Serpent King.<br />
[20300310] Join the Serpent King, as family...<br />
[20300400] And devour the gods with me!<br />
[20300410] Together, we will devour the very gods!  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[20390000]  <br />
[20390100]  <br />
[20390200]  <br />
[20390300]  <br />
[20390400]    </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[20391000] General Radahn is cursed ever to wander.<br />
[20391010] Before we begin, allow me to paint you the full picture.<br />
[20391100] Eaten from the inside, by Malenia's scarlet rot, his wits are long gone.<br />
[20391200] Now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them, like a dog.<br />
[20391300] Howling at the sky.  </p>
<h3>0204</h3>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[20430000] O Erdtree, you shall burn.<br />
[20430100] Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.<br />
[20430200] Thank you. For guiding me here.<br />
[20430300] The one who walks alongside flame,<br />
[20430400] Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.<br />
[20430500] Good-bye.<br />
[20430600] I hope you will become Lord. Lord of each and all.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[20450000] Aaargh! Aargh!<br />
[20450100] <guttural moan><br />
[20450200] Nngghaa!<br />
[20450300] Argh!<br />
[20450400] <great howl>  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[20480000] Now wilt ye serve, each and all.<br />
[20480010] The Elden Lord is crowned.<br />
[20480100] The new Elden Lord,
steward of a fracturing world.<br />
[20480110] And so beginneth the age of fracture...  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[20481000] The fallen leaves tell a story.<br />
[20481100] Of how a Tarnished, of no renown, became Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[20482000] The fallen leaves tell a story.<br />
[20482100] Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.<br />
[20482200] In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[20483000] Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.<br />
[20483100] An Age of Fracture.  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[20484000] Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.<br />
[20484100] The Age of Order.<br />
[20484150] The Age Absolute.  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[20485000] Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.<br />
[20485100] The Age of the Duskborn  </p>
<h4>Section 86</h4>
<p>[20486000] Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.<br />
[20486100] The reviled curse that defined our age.<br />
[20486200] The Blessing of Despair.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[20490000] ...The battle is over, I see.<br />
[20490100] I do solemnly swear.<br />
[20490200] To every living being, and every living soul.<br />
[20490300] Now cometh the age of the stars.<br />
[20490400] A thousand year voyage
under the wisdom of the Moon.<br />
[20490500] Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.<br />
[20490600] Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...<br />
[20490700] As the path stretcheth into darkness...<br />
[20490800] Well then. Shall we?<br />
[20490900] My fair consort, eternal.  </p>
<h4>Section 95</h4>
<p>[20495000] ...The battle is over, I see.<br />
[20495010] ...All matters are settled, then.<br />
[20495100] I do solemnly swear.<br />
[20495200] To all the hearts that remain in thy thrall.<br />
[20495210] To all life, and the souls harboured therein.<br />
[20495300] Now comes the age of the mind.<br />
[20495400] A thousand year voyage,
governed by the wisdom of the Moon.<br />
[20495500] All shall be encompassed, in a still and silent night, unending.
And thought shall turn to fear,<br />
[20495600] emptiness, life...<br />
[20495700] And a path stretching into the darkness...<br />
[20495850] Let us go, together.<br />
[20495950] My dear consort, eternal.  </p>
<h3>0205</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[20500000] Lord of Frenzied Flame...<br />
[20500110] I will seek you, as far as you may travel...<br />
[20500200] To deliver you what is yours.<br />
[20500300] Destined Death.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[20540000] Young seedling, young seedling.<br />
[20540100] Return to the bosom of earth.<br />
[20540200] But remember well,<br />
[20540300] Thou'rt mine.<br />
[20540400] So shall I give of myself. This is for thee.<br />
[20540500] Mine abundance, my drop of dew.<br />
[20540600] Quench thy thirst, throughout thy frame.<br />
[20540700] Blossom and burgeon, time and again.<br />
[20540800] Grow larger, stronger.<br />
[20540900] Until the day cometh.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[20541000] When thou canst share in my dream.<br />
[20541100] Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.<br />
[20541200] Beget Order most elegant, from my tender reverie.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[20560000] If thou covetest the throne,<br />
[20560100] Impress my vision upon thine heart.<br />
[20560200] In the new world of thy making,<br />
[20560300] all things will flourish,<br />
[20560400] whether graceful, or malign.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[20580000] Greetings.<br />
[20580100] Traveller from beyond the Fog.<br />
[20580200] I am Melina.<br />
[20580300] I offer you an accord.  </p>
<h3>0206</h3>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[20640000] And one other. Whom grace would again bless.<br />
[20640100] A Tarnished of no renown.<br />
[20640200] Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.<br />
[20640300] to stand before the Elden Ring.<br />
[20640400] And become the Elden Lord.  </p>
<h3>0207</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[20700000] The Rune of Death is unbound.<br />
[20700100] Black flames have devoured the Erdtree,<br />
[20700110] and the Lands Between are shrouded by Death's dark fate.<br />
[20700200] But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.<br />
[20700300] Farewell it is, then.<br />
[20700400] You'll be Elden Lord, yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[20730000] Well, if you really are that gullible...<br />
[20730010] Ngh!<br />
[20730100] then stay away from the Volcano Manor!<br />
[20730200] Bye now!<br />
[20730300] Take care!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[20750100] Lord host, I could not be more content.<br />
[20750200] I found knowledge, and then found someone. That someone was you.<br />
[20750300] And now, inside you, here I am...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[20770000] Well well well?<br />
[20770100] I should have known, you scheming little thief.<br />
[20770200] The gods demand vengeance. Vengeance!  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[20780000] He he he he he...<br />
[20780100] My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.<br />
[20780200] You're the finest customer a man ever had!  </p>
<h3>0208</h3>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[20830000]  <br />
[20830100] This is how you die, you disgusting Tarnished.<br />
[20830200] Don't worry, I've got big plans for you. After you snuff it...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[20840000]  <br />
[20840100]  <br />
[20840200]    </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[20850000] <screaming><br />
[20850100]  <br />
[20850200]    </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[20860000] <screaming><br />
[20860100]  <br />
[20860200] (explained above)<br />
[20860300] Unleash it upon them! A cursed blessing to all!<br />
[20860400] (scream of pain)  </p>
<h3>Melina [1000]</h3>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[100010000] Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?<br />
[100010010] They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished.<br />
[100010020] But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.<br />
[100010030] I can play the role of maiden.<br />
[100010040] Turning runes into strength.<br />
[100010050] To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.<br />
[100010060] You need only take me with you.<br />
[100010070] To the foot of the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[100011000] Then it's settled.<br />
[100011010] Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength.<br />
[100011020] Ahh, another matter.<br />
[100011030] I bequeath to you this ring.<br />
[100011040] Use it to traverse great distances.<br />
[100011050] It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent.<br />
[100011060] Torrent has chosen you.<br />
[100011070] Treat him with respect.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[100012000] I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger.<br />
[100012010] Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.<br />
[100012020] Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[100013000] Have you reconsidered my offer?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[100020000] Shall I turn your runes to strength?<br />
[100020010] Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[100021000]    </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[100022000] Phew. It is done.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[100030000] This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree.<br />
[100030010] This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.<br />
[100030020] But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear.<br />
[100030030] You can see them, can't you?<br />
[100030040] The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[100031000] Me?<br />
[100031010] I'm searching.<br />
[100031020] For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago.<br />
[100031030] For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless.<br />
[100031040] There is something for which I must apologise.<br />
[100031050] I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance.<br />
[100031060] I am no maiden. My purpose…was long ago lost.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[100032000] Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer.<br />
[100032010] A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.<br />
[100032020] If the rays of grace signal the castle,<br />
[100032030] then the Elden Ring beckons you.<br />
[100032040] As an ally by pact,<br />
[100032050] ...I pray that you are fit...<br />
[100032060] To face the challenge presented by the Ring.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[100040000] Spoken echoes linger here.<br />
[100040010] Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago.<br />
[100040020] If you wish, I will share them with you.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[100041000] Very well. In Marika's own words.<br />
[100041010] My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.<br />
[100041020] With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.<br />
[100041030] Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.<br />
[100041040] Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[100042000] Of course. Perhaps there is no need.<br />
[100042010] Tell me if you should change your mind.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[100043000] Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well.<br />
[100043010] Shall I share them with you?  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[100044000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100044010] Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.<br />
[100044020] Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.<br />
[100044030] Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[100045000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100045010] The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.<br />
[100045020] Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.<br />
[100045030] To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.  </p>
<h3>1001</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[100101000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100101010] Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved.<br />
[100101020] Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God.<br />
[100101030] But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.<br />
[100101040] Amounting only to sacrifices...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[100102000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100102010] O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.<br />
[100102020] Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.<br />
[100102030] Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[100103000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100103010] I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.<br />
[100103020] Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.<br />
[100103030] Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.<br />
[100103040] My comrades; why must ye falter?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[100104000] In Marika's own words.<br />
[100104010] Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.<br />
[100104020] Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.<br />
[100104030] Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.<br />
[100104040] Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.<br />
[100104050] Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[100105000] Forgive me. I've been...testing you.<br />
[100105010] To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.<br />
[100105020] And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails.<br />
[100105030] It seems my worries were unfounded.<br />
[100105040] Torrent had your measure from the very start.<br />
[100105050] Whereas I merely pretended.<br />
[100105060] There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.<br />
[100105070] I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...<br />
[100105080] Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[100106000] Very well.<br />
[100106010] Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[100107000] Forgive me. I've been...testing you.<br />
[100107010] To determine if the Elden Ring would truly have you.<br />
[100107020] If you had the mettle to endure this long and arduous path.<br />
[100107030] It seems my worries were unfounded.<br />
[100107040] Torrent had your measure from the very start.<br />
[100107050] Whereas I merely pretended.<br />
[100107060] There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.<br />
[100107070] I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...<br />
[100107080] Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[100110000] Your seamster, Boc...<br />
[100110010] He is always eager to see your return.<br />
[100110020] Please, will you talk to him, when you can?<br />
[100110030] I'm sure he would be much contented.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[100111000] Your seamster, Boc...<br />
[100111010] I see him crying, from time to time.<br />
[100111020] I think he misses his mother.<br />
[100111030] He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful.<br />
[100111040] Does being born of a mother...<br />
[100111050] Mean one behaves in such a manner?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[100120000] ...<br />
[100120010] Is there...another person inside of you?<br />
[100120020] Did you...want that to happen?<br />
[100120030] I sense no malice. Do as you think best.<br />
[100120040] Hello, other you.<br />
[100120050] I am Melina, and I have an accord with this person.<br />
[100120060] We might be together for some time.<br />
[100120070] Pleased to meet you.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[100121000] ...<br />
[100121010] Is there...another person inside of you?<br />
[100121020] Did you...want that to happen?<br />
[100121030] I sense no malice. Do as you think best.<br />
[100121040] Hello, other you.<br />
[100121050] I am Melina, and I am travelling with this person.<br />
[100121060] We might be together for some time.<br />
[100121070] Pleased to meet you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[100130000] The Erdtree...is close.<br />
[100130010] Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled.<br />
[100130020] It takes me back.<br />
[100130030] I was born at the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
[100130040] Where mother gave me my purpose.<br />
[100130050] Though now, everything is lost to me.<br />
[100130060] I...have to ascertain for myself.<br />
[100130070] The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[100131000] My utmost thanks.<br />
[100131010] For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree.<br />
[100131020] Here, I can govern my own movement.<br />
[100131030] And thus, the accord is fulfilled.<br />
[100131040] I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given.<br />
[100131050] Farewell.<br />
[100131060] I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you.<br />
[100131070] I wish you luck, in realising your ambition.<br />
[100131080] You have fought long and hard.<br />
[100131090] I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[100140000] Hello again, old friend.<br />
[100140010] It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion.<br />
[100140020] Allow me a moment to converse with you.<br />
[100140030] You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no?<br />
[100140040] Prevented by the mantle of barbs.<br />
[100140050] The thorns are impenetrable.<br />
[100140060] A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without.<br />
[100140070] The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...<br />
[100140080] and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns.<br />
[100140090] My purpose serves to aid in that very act.<br />
[100140100] So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.<br />
[100140110] To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
[100140120] Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.<br />
[100140130] And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[100141000] I wish to journey with you once more.<br />
[100141010] To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
[100141020] Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.<br />
[100141030] And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[100150000] Think not, of the kindling.<br />
[100150010] I shall see to that.<br />
[100150020] All I ask of you is to make the journey.<br />
[100150030] To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.<br />
[100150040] I know...<br />
[100150050] I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.<br />
[100150060] But it must be done to reach the path beyond.<br />
[100150070] And that is the path I wish to travel.<br />
[100150080] What is your mind?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[100160000] There is something I'd like to say.<br />
[100160010] My purpose was given to me by my mother.<br />
[100160020] But now, I act of my own volition.<br />
[100160030] I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.<br />
[100160040] Regardless of my mother's designs.<br />
[100160050] I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.<br />
[100160060] Not even you.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[100170000] We're almost there.<br />
[100170010] The flame of ruin lies just ahead.<br />
[100170020] I'm glad it was you I travelled with.<br />
[100170030] I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too.<br />
[100170040] Thank you, Torrent.<br />
[100170050] Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[100171000] I have long observed the Lands Between.<br />
[100171010] This world is in dire need of repair...<br />
[100171020] and Death...indiscriminate...<br />
[100171030] Are you prepared...<br />
[100171040] To commit a cardinal sin?  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[100172000] Very well.<br />
[100172010] Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[100173000] Very well.<br />
[100173010] Tell me, when you are fully prepared.  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[100174000] Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin?  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[100180000] If you intend to claim the frenzied flame,<br />
[100180010] I ask that you cease.<br />
[100180020] It is not to be meddled with.<br />
[100180030] It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.<br />
[100180040] However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair...<br />
[100180050] Life endures. Births continue.<br />
[100180060] There is beauty in that, is there not?<br />
[100180070] If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.<br />
[100180080] Please, leave the frenzied flame alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[100181000] I shall see to the kindling.<br />
[100181010] It is a purpose which I choose to fulfil.<br />
[100181020] So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[100182000] The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with.<br />
[100182010] It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.<br />
[100182020] So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[100185000] I ask you, one more time.<br />
[100185010] Please, seek not the frenzied flame.<br />
[100185020] As one who strives to become a Lord,<br />
[100185030] deny not the lives, the new births of this world.<br />
[100185040] Those who would are not fit to be called Lord.<br />
[100185050] When the land they preside over is lifeless.  </p>
<h4>Section 86</h4>
<p>[100186000] Please, put a stop to this madness.<br />
[100186010] The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all.<br />
[100186020] When the land they preside over is lifeless.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[100190000] You...have inherited the frenzied flame.<br />
[100190010] A pity. You are no longer fit.<br />
[100190020] Our accord ends here.<br />
[100190030] But remember...<br />
[100190040] Should you rise, as the Lord of Chaos,<br />
[100190050] I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.<br />
[100190060] Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.<br />
[100190070] Goodbye, my companion.<br />
[100190080] Goodbye, Torrent...  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[100191000] You...have inherited the frenzied flame.<br />
[100191010] A pity. You are no longer fit.<br />
[100191020] Our journey together ends here.<br />
[100191030] And remember...<br />
[100191040] Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos,<br />
[100191050] I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.<br />
[100191060] Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.<br />
[100191070] Goodbye, my companion.<br />
[100191080] Goodbye, Torrent...  </p>
<h3>1009</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[100900000]  <br />
[100900010]  <br />
[100900020]    </p>
<h3>1010</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101001000] You, please, I can read them.<br />
[101001010] Your fingers, please, your fingers...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101002000] Oh, bless you.<br />
[101002010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101002020] Within the fog, a gaping hole. Beyond the fog, one cursed by blood.<br />
[101002030] Below the surface, traces of those who lurk in the shadows.<br />
[101002040] In the east, the east. Should you desire…  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[101003000] Oh, bless you.<br />
[101003010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101003020] ...<br />
[101003030] Heavens, how can this be!<br />
[101003040] A dreadful sign! Truly dreadful!<br />
[101003050] You will face wrath, then madness, and finally, chaos.<br />
[101003060] Turn back.<br />
[101003070] This is a path you must forsake.<br />
[101003080] Dread awaits you in the south. Blackest dread!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101010000] Dragon slayer...<br />
[101010010] Ohhh, dragon slayer...<br />
[101010020] You unfeeling barbarian.<br />
[101010030] Planning to feast? On dragon?<br />
[101010040] At an abandoned church on that wee isle.<br />
[101010050] You would devour the heart of an ancient?<br />
[101010060] You wretched, undeserving brute!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[101050000] Oh, bless you.<br />
[101050010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101050020] Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished...<br />
[101050030] Traverse Raya Lucaria; "Glintstone Eventide"…<br />
[101050040] …and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift.<br />
[101050050] Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed.<br />
[101050060] Only, why should that matter!<br />
[101050070] Stormveil Castle still stands tall!  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[101060000] Oh, bless you.<br />
[101060010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101060020] ...<br />
[101060030] Miquella's favour can be yours…<br />
[101060040] Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The all-hearing slaughtered, but alas, it was for naught.<br />
[101060050] But all you need do, is snatch it from the big pot.<br />
[101060060] ...<br />
[101060070] Pity the poor, poor fool!  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[101070000] Oh, bless you.<br />
[101070010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101070020] ...<br />
[101070030] …Are you one for festivals? Or flowers?<br />
[101070040] To the South, a grand festival to make the stars turn.<br />
[101070050] To the East, the hardened bud of a flower to be.<br />
[101070060] But dare you enter?<br />
[101070070] Into the heart of the scarlet rot?<br />
[101070080] Ah...ahhh...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[101080000] What a pity it is, to be without the right.<br />
[101080010] All you can do is stand, at a loss.<br />
[101080020] Without even the half crescents that wish to be whole.<br />
[101080030] Before the unmoving, unfeeling Grand Lift ahead.<br />
[101080040] ...<br />
[101080050] Or, are you planning to throw yourself to the waters?<br />
[101080060] To find the coward's passage, through the dim cavern?<br />
[101080070] What a pity it is, to be without the right.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[101081000] Oh, bless you...<br />
[101081010] Bless you...<br />
[101081020] ...<br />
[101081030] You. The one who holds both half crescents.<br />
[101081040] Take the path to the Grand Lift ahead.<br />
[101081050] For you...are the one who will be Lord.<br />
[101081060] ...<br />
[101081070] Bear witness, one and all! The Lord is returned!<br />
[101081080] The Elden Lord is come again!  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[101090000] Oh, bless you...<br />
[101090010] Oh..ohh!<br />
[101090020] ...<br />
[101090030] To the east...ruins of gold. To the west...the serpent's sacrilege.<br />
[101090040] Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow.<br />
[101090050] Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow.<br />
[101090060] Tis a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika!<br />
[101090070] Ah...ahh... Ha...ha...  </p>
<h3>1011</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101100000] The Fingers I served once prophesied...<br />
[101100010] A Tarnished would one day become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.<br />
[101100020] ...<br />
[101100030] Surely you see it, too?<br />
[101100040] The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.<br />
[101100050] O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree.<br />
[101100060] ...<br />
[101100070] And whatever you might face...<br />
[101100080] The Fingers will surely guide you...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101110000] Turn back.<br />
[101110010] Ahead lies the Land of the Giants' Flame.<br />
[101110020] And the way forth is forbidden.<br />
[101110030] ...<br />
[101110040] Hear me. The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.<br />
[101110050] Doing so will unbind Destined Death, and slay the world itself.<br />
[101110060] ...<br />
[101110070] Who would dare put you up to such a task?<br />
[101110080] Most certainly not the Fingers!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101120000] Ohh...<br />
[101120010] Oh, Lord Godwyn...<br />
[101120020] Such cruelty, such humiliation...<br />
[101120030] My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.<br />
[101120040] As the first of the demigods to die.<br />
[101120050] As a martyr to Destined Death.<br />
[101120060] But why must it yet bring such disgrace?<br />
[101120070] A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...<br />
[101120080] How could such a thing come to be...<br />
[101120090] <sobbing>  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101121000] Ohh...<br />
[101121010] Oh, Lord Godwyn...<br />
[101121020] My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.<br />
[101121030] A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...<br />
[101121040] How could such a thing come to be...<br />
[101121050] <sobbing>  </p>
<h3>1018</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101800000] Ha, ha, ha!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101801000] A curse! A curse upon you!<br />
[101801010] Your path leads only to death!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101802000] You godless brute.<br />
[101802010] You'll soil your hands soon enough.<br />
[101802020] With mortal sin!  </p>
<h3>Finger Reader Enia [1020]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102001000] Are you that new Tarnished?<br />
[102001010] You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader.<br />
[102001020] I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.<br />
[102001030] Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer.<br />
[102001040] Let their wisdom wash over you.<br />
[102001050] "Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order."<br />
[102001060] "Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy."<br />
[102001070] "Until it was shattered."<br />
[102001080] "The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll."<br />
[102001090] "Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces."<br />
[102001100] "Foul curses and misery spread, unabating."<br />
[102001110] "But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it."<br />
[102001120] "So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act."<br />
[102001130] "Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring."<br />
[102001140] "Seek another of its kind."<br />
[102001150] "To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."<br />
[102001170] Let the words of the Fingers guide you.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[102002000] Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods;<br />
[102002010] the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring.<br />
[102002020] Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord.<br />
[102002030] And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished.<br />
[102002040] Listen, the Fingers speak.<br />
[102002050] "The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods."<br />
[102002060] "Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left."<br />
[102002070] "The Fingers have willed it so."<br />
[102002080] ...Indeed. But remember one thing.<br />
[102002090] The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.<br />
[102002100] Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation...<br />
[102002110] The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[102003000] Well, well… I see…<br />
[102003010] A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession.<br />
[102003020] Demigods, and even the greater of the champions,<br />
[102003030] are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.<br />
[102003040] They are…valuable indeed.<br />
[102003050] These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters.<br />
[102003060] And should you wish to wield that same power, well…<br />
[102003070] I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.<br />
[102003080] Heh… Do not recoil from my offer.<br />
[102003090] The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[102004000] Ah. You have returned. What is it?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[102005000] Now, go forth.<br />
[102005010] Let the words of the Fingers guide you.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[102010000] I had my doubts, but...my, look at you.<br />
[102010010] Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.<br />
[102010020] Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.<br />
[102010030] "Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased."<br />
[102010040] "You have earned the right to become Elden Lord."<br />
[102010050] "Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika."<br />
[102010060] "To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."<br />
[102010070] The Fingers expect...<br />
[102010080] As much from you as they do young Gideon.<br />
[102010090] Take this. A token of farewell.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[102011000] Now, go forth.<br />
[102011010] Become Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[102012000] Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.<br />
[102012010] A god, in truth.<br />
[102012020] But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.<br />
[102012030] A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood.<br />
[102012040] The Fingers speak...<br />
[102012050] "Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence."<br />
[102012060] "But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel."<br />
[102012070] "Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort."<br />
[102012080] "The Fingers have willed it so."<br />
[102012090] Now, you may go.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[102020000] Well, you managed to return.<br />
[102020010] You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.<br />
[102020020] The Fingers remain still.<br />
[102020030] Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.<br />
[102020040] When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance.<br />
[102020050] But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.<br />
[102020060] No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait...<br />
[102020070] My, oh, my...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[102021000] It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance.<br />
[102021010] My, oh, my. Whatever will you do…  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[102030000] Heavens forbid...<br />
[102030010] That is not the domain of mere men.<br />
[102030020] The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too?<br />
[102030030] The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.<br />
[102030040] The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation…<br />
[102030050] Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...<br />
[102030060] The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.<br />
[102030070] ...<br />
[102030080] ...<br />
[102030090] But here we are...<br />
[102030100] The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.<br />
[102030110] The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.<br />
[102030120] Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?<br />
[102030130] Go on. Finish the job.<br />
[102030140] Take the course you deem most worthy.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[102031000] You must find kindling.<br />
[102031010] Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.<br />
[102031020] But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.<br />
[102031030] For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.<br />
[102031040] And can lead you to the Rune of Death.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[102040000] You've done it, I see.<br />
[102040010] What use do you have for me, now?<br />
[102040020] I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again.<br />
[102040030] Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you.<br />
[102040040] Now, you may go.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[102041000] Heh, heh, heh.<br />
[102041010] You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now?<br />
[102041020] A harder taskmaster have I never met.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[102042000] Don't worry, my dear.<br />
[102042010] I'll see it to the end with you, if it please.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[102043000] Now, go forth.<br />
[102043010] Do what you believe is right.  </p>
<h3>1021</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[102100000] Oh, such a fine gift, I will gladly accept.<br />
[102100010] But don't raise your hopes;<br />
[102100020] I have no secrets for you to plunder.<br />
[102100030] I lost my appetite for them a lifetime ago, or more.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102101000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h3>Ranni the Witch [1060]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106001000] A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.<br />
[106001010] I am the witch Renna.<br />
[106001020] I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.<br />
[106001030] And upon looking into the matter,<br />
[106001040] the talk, I surmise, is of thee.<br />
[106001050] Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?<br />
[106001060] To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106002000] Ah. As I had hoped.<br />
[106002010] I was entrusted this, for thee.<br />
[106002020] By Torrent's former master.<br />
[106002030] Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.<br />
[106002040] Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.<br />
[106002050] The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.<br />
[106002060] Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106003000] Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.<br />
[106003010] I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.<br />
[106003020] How long will it be, I wonder...<br />
[106003030] Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?<br />
[106003040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106004000] This way, Tarnished.<br />
[106004010] May I have a word?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106010000] Trifle not with me, Tarnished.<br />
[106010010] Or didst thou merely forget?<br />
[106010020] The name of the spectral steed thou callest?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106011000] I will ask thee again.<br />
[106011010] Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?<br />
[106011020] To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106012000] Quite the stubborn one, aren't we?<br />
[106012010] Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty.<br />
[106012020] Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit.<br />
[106012030] I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master.<br />
[106012040] Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion.<br />
[106012050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106020000] What hopest thou to profit?<br />
[106020010] ...<br />
[106020020] No sense in arguing, I see.<br />
[106020030] Thou'rt a wild one, indeed.<br />
[106020040] Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen...<br />
[106020050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106030000] Let us speak of the past, a while.<br />
[106030010] I was once an Empyrean.<br />
[106030020] Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.<br />
[106030030] Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.<br />
[106030040] But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.<br />
[106030050] I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.<br />
[106030060] I would not be controlled by that thing.<br />
[106030070] The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...<br />
[106030080] And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.  </p>
<h3>Renna the Witch [1061]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106101000] Oh, again we cross paths.<br />
[106101010] I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.<br />
[106101020] It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...<br />
[106101030] But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?<br />
[106101040] I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106102000] Mm? a Tarnished, here?<br />
[106102010] Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way.<br />
[106102020] Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106110000] I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.<br />
[106110010] Indeed, I am the witch Ranni.<br />
[106110020] I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.<br />
[106110030] I did it all.<br />
[106110040] But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.<br />
[106110050] I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.<br />
[106110060] And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106111000] Hah!<br />
[106111010] And why should I reveal that to thee?<br />
[106111020] I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,<br />
[106111030] but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot.<br />
[106111040] The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.<br />
[106111050] Now, begone.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106112000] The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.<br />
[106112010] Now, begone.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106113000] Oh, is that so?<br />
[106113010] Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?<br />
[106113020] Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?<br />
[106113030] ...<br />
[106113040] Very well...<br />
[106113050] There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.<br />
[106113060] What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,<br />
[106113070] I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...<br />
[106113080] I'll allow it. Enter my service.<br />
[106113090] And good hunting to thee.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106120000] Hah!<br />
[106120010] No reason in particular, thou claimest?<br />
[106120020] Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.<br />
[106120030] Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter.<br />
[106120040] ...<br />
[106120050] Wilt thou enter into my service?<br />
[106120060] I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.<br />
[106120070] That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.<br />
[106120080] Well? Has that roused thy interest?  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106121000] I see. A choice well made.<br />
[106121010] Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.<br />
[106121020] But I require as much of those under my command.<br />
[106121030] I anticipate good work from thee.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106122000] I see. More's the pity.<br />
[106122010] Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart.<br />
[106122020] Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch...<br />
[106122030] Is not as frightful as thou fearest...  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106123000] Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause?<br />
[106123010] Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service?  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106130000] Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.<br />
[106130010] There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.<br />
[106130020] I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.<br />
[106130030] I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.<br />
[106130040] Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.<br />
[106130050] Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.<br />
[106130060] I am sure the others will be doing just the same.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106131000] Speak with the three who await thee below.<br />
[106131010] Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.<br />
[106131020] It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106135000] Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.<br />
[106135010] Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave?<br />
[106135020] It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron.<br />
[106135030] Go there to find the city's hidden treasure.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106136000] Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below.<br />
[106136010] Like thee, they are in my service.<br />
[106136020] Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.<br />
[106136030] I am sure the others will be doing just the same.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106137000] Speak with the three who await thee below.<br />
[106137010] Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.<br />
[106137020] It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106140000] Ah, allow me to forewarn thee.<br />
[106140010] I shall soon enter my slumber.<br />
[106140020] And it will be some time before I wake.<br />
[106140030] This doll's body is not without its hindrances...<br />
[106140040] Still, I have high hopes for thee.<br />
[106140050] I look forward to the good news when I arise.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[106141000] I shall soon enter my slumber.<br />
[106141010] And it will be some time before I wake.<br />
[106141020] I have high hopes for thee.<br />
[106141030] I look forward to the good news when I arise.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[106145000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[106170000] Ahh...It was thee.<br />
[106170010] Not Blaidd, it seemeth.<br />
[106170020] Even in my slumber, I sensed it.<br />
[106170030] It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?<br />
[106170040] My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.<br />
[106170050] Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[106171000] Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this.<br />
[106171010] Take it.<br />
[106171020] My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it.<br />
[106171030] Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire.<br />
[106171040] I can fathom what thy purpose might be.<br />
[106171050] Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see.<br />
[106171060] You may leave now.<br />
[106171070] It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[106172000] What is it?<br />
[106172010] Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not?<br />
[106172020] You may leave now.<br />
[106172030] I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[106175000] Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.<br />
[106175010] My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.<br />
[106175020] A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.<br />
[106175030] I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.<br />
[106175040] I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter.<br />
[106175050] I must thank Torrent too, for his part.<br />
[106175060] You may leave now.<br />
[106175070] It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[106176000] What is it? You may go.<br />
[106176010] I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[106190000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[106191000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[106192000] ...<br />
[106192010] Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?<br />
[106192020] Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?<br />
[106192030] Fine...fine.<br />
[106192040] I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise.<br />
[106192050] But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.<br />
[106192060] Perform for me a service, as recompense.<br />
[106192070] Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.<br />
[106192080] The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.<br />
[106192090] I will not brook disobedience in this matter.  </p>
<h4>Section 93</h4>
<p>[106193000] Perform for me a service, as recompense.<br />
[106193010] Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.<br />
[106193020] The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.<br />
[106193030] I will not brook disobedience in this matter.  </p>
<h3>1062</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106200000] Let us speak of the past, a while.<br />
[106200010] I was once an Empyrean.<br />
[106200020] Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.<br />
[106200030] Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.<br />
[106200040] Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.<br />
[106200050] But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.<br />
[106200060] I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.<br />
[106200070] I would not be controlled by that thing.<br />
[106200080] The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...<br />
[106200090] And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106201000] I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since.<br />
[106201010] The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106210000] Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.<br />
[106210010] Blaidd remained my loyal ally.<br />
[106210020] Heh.<br />
[106210030] Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,<br />
[106210040] He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.<br />
[106210050] Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.<br />
[106210060] Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...<br />
[106210070] That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.<br />
[106210080] Ah, should I add thee to the list?<br />
[106210090] Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106211000] Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue.<br />
[106211010] I've let slip too much.<br />
[106211020] Forget what thou'st heard. Forget.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106220000] O Shadow, thou'rt the last.<br />
[106220010] Tell the Two Fingers,<br />
[106220020] That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh.<br />
[106220030] With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106230000] Beautifully fought.<br />
[106230010] My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned.<br />
[106230020] Now I can finally stand before them.<br />
[106230030] This is farewell, my dear.<br />
[106230040] Tell Blaidd, and Iji...<br />
[106230050] I love them.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106240000] So, it was thee, who would become my Lord.<br />
[106240010] Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.<br />
[106240020] I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.<br />
[106240030] I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.<br />
[106240040] I bid thee travel the path of the Lord.<br />
[106240050] And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[106250000] ...<br />
[106250010] I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised.<br />
[106250020] I thought I might expound a little further...<br />
[106250030] Upon the order I envision.<br />
[106250040] Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.<br />
[106250050] I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.<br />
[106250060] As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove.<br />
[106250070] And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...<br />
[106250080] All become impossibilities.<br />
[106250090] Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.<br />
[106250100] Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[106251000] Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.<br />
[106251010] And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order.<br />
[106251020] Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[106260000] Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening.<br />
[106260010] The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.<br />
[106260020] I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.<br />
[106260030] Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand,<br />
[106260040] Didst thou think to have thy way with me?<br />
[106260050] Be gone. Hapless scum.<br />
[106260060] I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[106261000] I have spoken. Away from my sight.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[106262000] This is the third time, fiend.<br />
[106262010] Enough of thy unbearable breath.  </p>
<h3>1063</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106300000] What hopest thou to profit?<br />
[106300010] ...<br />
[106300020] To think such was thy plot.<br />
[106300030] Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies.<br />
[106300040] I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.<br />

<p>[207801000] Great Godfrey, didst thou witness?  </p>

<p>[209905000] Ahh, I can see it, as clear as day!<br />
[209905010] The coming of our dynasty!<br />

<p>[209906000] Ahh, Miquella...<br />

<h3>Smithing Master Hewg [2130]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[213001000] You're a new face.<br />
[213001010] No matter, it's all the same.<br />
[213001020] Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[213002000] Back already?<br />
[213002010] No matter. Lay out your arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[213003000] Back already? Can't get enough, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[213010000] Well, where've you been hiding?<br />
[213010010] I took you for dead.<br />
[213010020] No matter. It's all the same.<br />
[213010030] Lay out your arms, then.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[213020000] I see you've noticed the chains.<br />
[213020010] Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.<br />
[213020020] I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools.<br />
[213020030] That's all there is to it.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[213021000] Nah, don't read too much into it.<br />
[213021010] I've no grudge against you.<br />
[213021020] My being a prisoner is no fault of yours.<br />
[213021030] Besides, I don't mind smithing.<br />
[213021040] Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails.<br />
[213021050] Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[213022000] Like the look of that whetstone knife, do you?<br />
[213022010] I've no need for it.<br />
[213022020] You're welcome to take it. Go ahead.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[213030000] Now, look at you.<br />
[213030010] Those eyes tell a story.<br />
[213030020] Of a challenger, who's felled his mark.<br />
[213030021] Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.<br />
[213030030] Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[213040000] Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness.<br />
[213040010] The road is yet long. A god is not easily felled.<br />
[213040020] But one day, without fail, you will have your wish.<br />
[213040030] So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[213041000] Those words were not meant for you.<br />
[213041010] I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.<br />
[213041020] But my prayers are mine and mine alone.<br />
[213041030] Good. I'll be more careful too.<br />
[213041040] Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[213042000] Ah. You, is it?<br />
[213042010] I...didn't notice you there.<br />
[213042020] I'll be doing my job, same as ever.<br />
[213042030] Just lay out your arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[213050000] The girl you brought here...<br />
[213050010] She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade,<br />
[213050020] but she has a gift for spirit tuning.<br />
[213050030] I saw another one like her, long ago.<br />
[213050040] Their eyes share the same hue.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[213051000] The girl? What about her?  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[213052000] Are you out of your mind?<br />
[213052010] Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?<br />
[213052020] Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[213053000] I refuse to believe it.<br />
[213053010] I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[213060000] I spoke with the girl.<br />
[213060010] She has a gift for spirit tuning.<br />
[213060020] So I told her everything I know.<br />
[213060030] I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago.<br />
[213060040] It was all I could do to honour her.<br />
[213060050] I'm sorry I doubted you.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[213070000] The girl has come a long way.<br />
[213070010] As ever, time and technique have made her stronger.<br />
[213070020] Tis good to see.<br />
[213070030] An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.<br />
[213070040] But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.<br />
[213070050] I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[213080000] No, no, no, no...<br />
[213080010] I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.<br />
[213080020] I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[213081000] Oh, it's you.<br />
[213081010] Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.<br />
[213081020] Just lay out your arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[213090000] Are you having second thoughts?<br />
[213090010] Might I have a word, then?<br />
[213090020] Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.<br />
[213090030] The demigods. And their god.<br />
[213090040] If you remain loyal to your calling,<br />
[213090050] then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,<br />
[213090060] I will never cease to smith your weapons.<br />
[213090070] Until you have one to slay a god.  </p>
<h3>2131</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[213100000] I knew you'd be back.<br />
[213100010] Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[213101000] Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[213110000] Weren't you listening?<br />
[213110010] As I've always said.<br />
[213110020] You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.<br />
[213110030] And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.<br />
[213110040] It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[213111000] I've upset the girl.<br />
[213111010] She says that now that my chains are broken, I'm free.<br />
[213111020] That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.<br />
[213111030]  <br />
[213111040] What use have I for freedom now?<br />
[213111050] I smith weapons to slay a god.<br />
[213111060] I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.<br />
[213111070] Is there any other way?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[213120000] Oh, finally! It's complete!<br />
[213120010] I've done it! A weapon to slay a god!<br />
[213120020] Oh, you have my deepest gratitude.<br />
[213120030] Thanks to you, my wish is granted.<br />
[213120040] Now wield it, and kill them.<br />
[213120050] The demigods. And their god.<br />
[213120060] Queen Marika herself wishes it so.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[213121000] You seek better weapons still?<br />
[213121010] Very well. I'll smith another, if needed.<br />
[213121020] A weapon to slay a god.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[213122000] I'll smith as long as you like.<br />
[213122010] Now, lay out your arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[213123000] I'll smith...as long as you like.<br />
[213123010] Now...lay out your...arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[213124000] I'll smith...as long...as you like.<br />
[213124010] Now...lay out...your...arms.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[213130000] Use my masterpiece to slay a god.<br />
[213130010] That is all that I have lived for.<br />
[213130020] And my promise to Q-queen Marika.<br />
[213130030] But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[213131000] I can't hold on much longer.<br />
[213131010] I'm going the way of the R-roundtable...<br />
[213131020] It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.<br />
[213131030] Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends.<br />
[213131040] My lord, f-for that is what you are.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[213140000] Who are you?<br />
[213140010] Oh, I must be a blacksmith.<br />
[213140020] Now, let's get smithing...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[213141000] Could you tell me what happened?<br />
[213141010] Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?<br />
[213141020] Why does that girl weep for me?<br />
[213141030] Have I forgotten something of dire importance?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[213150000] Now, let's get smithing...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[213160000] ...<br />
[213160010] I-I smith... I do...  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[213171000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h3>2149</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[214900000] A fine sacrifice indeed.<br />
[214900010] Let us devour the gods, together!<br />
[214900900] Now you are family.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[214901000] Now, we can devour the gods, together!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[214902000] O shapers of gods, meddlers in fortune.<br />
[214902010] I do not abide! By your suffocating Order.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[214903000]  <br />
[214903100]  <br />
[214903200]    </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[214904000] So must it be.<br />
[214904010] Eveligne, show him the way...<br />
[214904011] Eveligne, show her the way...<br />
[214904020] ...to devour the gods.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[214905000] No one will hold me captive.<br />
[214905010] A serpent never dies.<br />
[214905020] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h3>Blaidd the Half-Wolf [2160]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[216001000] <howl>  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[216002000] Who goes there?<br />
[216002010] Kalé send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody.<br />
[216002020] Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange.<br />
[216002030] The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil".<br />
[216002040] He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard.<br />
[216002050] Come tell me if you find him before I do.<br />
[216002060] I can offer you ample reward.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[216003000] Darriwil is nothing but a traitor.<br />
[216003010] And in need of a fitting end to his tale.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[216010000] Darriwil...<br />
[216010010] Rotting in a cell is no true justice.<br />
[216010020] No, this is where it ends for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[216020000] ...Right. There you are.<br />
[216020010] Had to work for it, but it's done.<br />
[216020020] Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[216021000] Oh yes, I should say,<br />
[216021010] If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side...<br />
[216021020] Tell him I sent you.<br />
[216021030] And he'll be sure to treat you right.<br />
[216021040] I owe you one, I reckon.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[216022000] That's enough chit-chat for now.<br />
[216022010] It's time we parted ways.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[216030000] Ahh, long time, friend.<br />
[216030010] Blaidd, if you've forgotten.<br />
[216030020] Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni.<br />
[216030030] Well. Getting right to business...<br />
[216030040] I'm still in Limgrave.<br />
[216030050] The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.<br />
[216030060] I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.<br />
[216030070] See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...<br />
[216030080] See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[216031000] Ah. I heard about you. Good to finally meet.<br />
[216031010] Name's Blaidd, sworn sword to mistress Ranni.<br />
[216031020] Glad to have you aboard.<br />
[216031030] Well. Getting right to business...<br />
[216031040] I'm situated in Limgrave right now.<br />
[216031050] The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.<br />
[216031060] I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.<br />
[216031070] See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[216032000] I'm going below through the well in the Mistwood.<br />
[216032010] See if I can't find the road to Nokron...<br />
[216032020] Don't keep me waiting, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[216040000] Ah, good to see you.<br />
[216040010] Apologies mate, but I don't have much to report.<br />
[216040020] I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I'm absolutely stumped.<br />
[216040030] I've tried all the gateways, to no avail...<br />
[216040040] ...Perhaps it's time to ask Seluvis?<br />
[216040050] I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something...<br />
[216040060] Let's give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[216041000] I jest, I wouldn't go that far.<br />
[216041010] Besides, I should check on some things here.<br />
[216041020] Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.<br />
[216041030] If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[216042000] Ah. Well met.<br />
[216042010] What news?  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[216043000] Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.<br />
[216043010] If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?<br />
[216043020] And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.<br />
[216043030] Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[216050000] Hmm...<br />
[216050010] So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...<br />
[216050020] That reminds me of something I heard.<br />
[216050030] There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave.<br />
[216050040] It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods...<br />
[216050050] Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating.<br />
[216050060] I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[216051000] You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities...<br />
[216051010] I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.<br />
[216051020] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[216052000] Right. I see.<br />
[216052010] Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.<br />
[216052020] If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[216053000] Hmm...<br />
[216053010] So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...<br />
[216053020] And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid,<br />
[216053030] where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods.<br />
[216053040] It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something.<br />
[216053050] I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[216060000] Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time.<br />
[216060020] The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain...<br />
[216060030] Let's give them a show to remember, eh.<br />
[216060040] Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[216061000] Once more into the fray together, eh.<br />
[216061010] Heh. This might even be fun.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[216062000] Into the fray together, eh.<br />
[216062010] Heh. Let's see what you're made of.  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[216063000] Ah, thought I might find you here.<br />
[216063010] I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting.<br />
[216063020] But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh.<br />
[216063030] You must have heard by now, right?<br />
[216063040] That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis.<br />
[216063050] But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion.<br />
[216063060] So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all.<br />
[216063070] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[216064000] Hm. Long time.<br />
[216064010] Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths.<br />
[216064020] Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.<br />
[216064030] The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang.  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[216065000] Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself.<br />
[216065010] Blaidd, warrior.<br />
[216065020] Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.<br />
[216065030] The way ahead is pleasingly simple; a path forged by sword and fang.  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[216066000] Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[216080000] Ah, good. I was waiting for you.<br />
[216080010] What a sick way to fight, eh.<br />
[216080020] The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.<br />
[216080030] And hah! Did you see that, afterwards?<br />
[216080040] A falling star, right before our eyes!<br />
[216080050] I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.<br />
[216080060] He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.<br />
[216080070] And, the path has now been cleared.<br />
[216080080] To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided.<br />
[216080090] Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.<br />
[216080100] We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[216081000] Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.<br />
[216081010] And we'll go into battle again, side by side.<br />
[216081020] My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang.<br />
[216081030] The curtain's rising...on the final act.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[216082000] Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate.<br />
[216082010] The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.<br />
[216082020] And then a falling star, right before our eyes!<br />
[216082030] I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.<br />
[216082040] He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[216083000] Well, it's time I left.<br />
[216083010] The wheel of fate has been set into motion.<br />
[216083020] If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.<br />
[216083030] You are a fine warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[216084000] If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.<br />
[216084010] You are a fine warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[216090000] <howl>  </p>
<h3>Baleful Shadow [2161]</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[216100000] Oh, it's you...<br />
[216100010] It's me, Blaidd.<br />
[216100020] Old Iji trapped me here.<br />
[216100030] Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni.<br />
[216100040] But there's no chance that could happen.<br />
[216100050] I'm part of her being. Her very shadow...<br />
[216100060] I thought old Iji knew as much...<br />
[216100070] Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[216101000] I don't understand. Why would Iji do this...<br />
[216101010] I could never intend harm to Lady Ranni. What's he thinking...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[216110000] My thanks, friend.<br />
[216110010] I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.<br />
[216110020] I don't know what came over old Iji,<br />
[216110030] but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.<br />
[216110040] Now, Ranni can finally set in motion<br />
[216110050] the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[216111000] I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.<br />
[216111010] I don't know what came over old Iji,<br />
[216111020] but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[216120000] ...<br />
[216120010] No. I'm part of her very being!<br />
[216120020] I could never betray her!<br />
[216120030] No matter what might happen...<br />
[216120040] Ranni... She needs me...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[216121000] <growling>  </p>
<h3>2168</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[216800000] Oh?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[216801000] What are you playing at?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[216802000] Fine.<br />
[216802010] Time to douse your little flame.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[216803000] Alright then.<br />
[216803010] Better to put you down now.<br />
[216803020] Before you trouble mistress Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[216804000] Hmph. Pathetic little man.<br />
[216804001] Hmph. Pathetic little woman.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[216805000] Don't show your face again.<br />
[216805010] Stay away from mistress Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[216806000] You're...you're strong of arm.<br />
[216806010] But ask yourself...<br />
[216806020] What harm can be done...to a shadow?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[216807000] Traitorous wretch...<br />
[216807010] You're...you're a danger...<br />
[216807011] From... From this woman…  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[216808000] Stop, please...<br />
[216808010] You think me a bringer of bale as well?<br />
[216808020] Fine. I am Ranni's shadow and it's for her that I fight.<br />
[216808030] Whatever any of you might call me.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[216809000] I am no bringer of bale.<br />
[216809010] I must return to Ranni's side.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[216810000] Tell...me...<br />
[216810010] Why... Why am I...bale to Ranni?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[216811000] Didn't I say? No harm can befall a shadow.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[216812000] I...am shadowbound.<br />
[216812010] Wherever mistress Ranni goes, I follow.<br />
[216812020] You are a danger. You die here.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[216813000] Rraargh!  </p>
<h3>2169</h3>

<h3>Asimi, Silver Tear [2180]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[218001000] Please, wait!<br />
[218001010] Proud Tarnished warrior. Before you kill me, let me speak.<br />
[218001020] I can aid you. Please, just hear me out.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[218002000] Thank you for listening.<br />
[218002010] I am Asimi. My true form is that of a silver tear.<br />
[218002020] I am a simple being who can assume the shapes of other living things.<br />
[218002030] But now, I've gained knowledge. I speak, and ponder, and...live in fear of death.<br />
[218002040] O, mighty Tarnished warrior, I beg of you.<br />
[218002050] Let me keep the life I've been granted. In exchange, I offer you power.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[218003000] Ahh, thank you.<br />
[218003010] Now, set your lips upon me, and breathe in deep.<br />
[218003020] I will live inside of you, and grant you strength untold.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[218004000] Onward, to our glorious future, my host...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[218005000] You won't listen to me, will you?<br />
[218005010] It's such a pity. I had a feeling you would become...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[218006000] Please, proud Tarnished warrior, I beg you reconsider.<br />
[218006010] The gifts I can bestow you in life far outstrip those which could be plundered from my corpse.<br />
[218006020] Please, can't you find it in your heart to trust me?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[218007000] So, you won't trust me.<br />
[218007010] But you still haven't killed me, have you.<br />
[218007020] Do you wish to think it over? Then I will wait.<br />
[218007030] For as long as it takes for you to trust me.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[218008000] Proud Tarnished Warrior, have you made up your mind?<br />
[218008010] I can grant you power, if you let me live.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[218010000] My lord host, do you hear that?<br />
[218010010] The sound of water. The river that flows in my home, the Eternal City.<br />
[218010020] Good lord host, I beg you, we must see the Eternal City.<br />
[218010030] To discover the ancient wonders of the stars. A wellspring of strength.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[218020000] My lord host, great lord host.<br />
[218020010] May I ask something of you?<br />
[218020020] A chalice is close by, the cradle of my kind...<br />
[218020030] Would you mind finding it for me?<br />
[218020040] Mm, you should find the chalice...and drink it dry.<br />
[218020050] Ahh, my lord host. I am terribly parched.<br />
[218020060] The chalice will quench my thirst, rejuvenate my flesh, and allow me to grant you further strength.<br />
[218020070] Please, my lord host. It is my only desire.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[218021000] Bless this brook of sustenance. My lord host...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[218030000] My lord host, great lord host.<br />
[218030010] A tear chalice lies in these lands, too.<br />
[218030020] A tear chalice lies in these lands.<br />
[218030030] Our mother chalice.<br />
[218030040] Please, search out this most sacred chalice.<br />
[218030050] It's suffused with the blessed wonders of the stars...<br />
[218030060] It will allow us to become a perfect whole.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[218040000] Now, lord host.<br />
[218040010] Please, drink every last drop from the mother chalice.<br />
[218040020] So that we may form a perfect whole.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[218041000] Oh no...<br />
[218041010] Excuse me, lord host.<br />
[218041020] I'm still so very, very parched.<br />
[218041030] In the other Eternal City, there's a cradle chalice to be found.<br />
[218041040] And if you were to drink the entirety of that one, first...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[218050000] Ahh, are you awake?<br />
[218050010] We've become a perfect whole.<br />
[218050020] There is nothing to fear. I will merely follow in your footsteps.<br />
[218050030] Living only as you would have yourself.<br />
[218050040] And I vow, that when I perfect your form.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[218060000] Ahh, how could you...<br />
[218060010] I was you, and only you. We were one...together.<br />
[218060020] Please, I only want to live...<br />
[218060030] I only wanted you...<br />
[218060040] to become Lord...<br />
[218060050] Gah...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[218070000] Oh...you found me...<br />
[218070010] I had hoped you wouldn't...<br />
[218070020] You could have become Elden Lord, and I could have become Sovereign Eternal, eventually.<br />
[218070030] If you hadn't found me, we both could have been Lords.  </p>
<h3>2188</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[218800000] I was wrong about you...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[218801000] My apologies, lord host.<br />
[218801010] I will take the throne.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[218802000] I'm...dying...<br />
[218802010] So this...is fear...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[218803000] I'm...glad...<br />
[218803010] My lord host, worthiest of lords...  </p>

<h3>Old Albus [2190]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[219001000] Ah!<br />
[219001010] Please, no. Dear me!<br />
[219001020] ...<br />
[219001030] I haven't a clue.<br />
[219001040] No secrets lie with me, not a one.<br />
[219001050] Oh, please. Leave me be.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[219002000] Wait, then, you're not one of them?<br />
[219002010] Well, what a relief.<br />
[219002020] ...<br />
[219002030] Oh, goodness me.<br />
[219002040] I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see.<br />
[219002050] We're finished. The whole village is finished.<br />
[219002060] The cursemongers have destroyed everything. No one that remains has their wits about them.<br />
[219002070] I beg you. Would you look after this medallion?<br />
[219002080] You must keep it out of the cursemongers' hands.<br />
[219002090] And if you should meet the young Albinauric Latenna,<br />
[219002100] then please, give it to her.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[219003000] A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics.<br />
[219003010] Miquella's city, far to the north, a place called Eburion, where we are conferred eternal grace.<br />
[219003020] The medallion is the key that leads to the city.<br />
[219003030] It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey.<br />
[219003040] But for dear Latenna, it is needed. To fulfil her purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[219004000] My legs will soon fade, and with them, my life.<br />
[219004010] Alas, this is the immovable fate of all Albinaurics.<br />
[219004020] ...<br />
[219004030] If only I could have gazed upon it, even once. The great chalk buttress of Eburion.<br />
[219004040] ...  </p>
<h3>2198</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[219800000] Ngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[219801000] We are Albinaurics.<br />
[219801010] We have caused you no harm!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[219802000] You merciless brutes.<br />
[219802010] Let the curse take everything.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[219803000] I will never give this up.<br />
[219803010] Not to your kind.  </p>
<h3>2199</h3>

<h3>Alexander, Warrior Jar [2200]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[220001000] Hello-o? Can you hear me?<br />
[220001010] Help me! I'm stuck!<br />
[220001020] Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[220002000] Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you!<br />
[220002010] I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here.<br />
[220002020] Please, can you help me out of this?<br />
[220002030] My thanks! A thousand thanks!<br />
[220002040] Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.<br />
[220002050] And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!<br />
[220002060] Don't dally. No no, there's no need to fret, I'm very well trained.<br />
[220002070] Give it your all, I say!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[220003000] Ah!<br />
[220003010] Ouuch!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[220004000] S-stop please! That's a little too rough for me, friend.<br />
[220004010] You'll crack me in half, like that! A little more gently, gently, please.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[220005000] Ahhh!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[220006000] Ahh! Well played, good sir. Well played!<br />
[220006001] Ahh! Well played, good lady. Well played!<br />
[220006010] Though that mighty wallop of yours almost spelt the end of me!<br />
[220006020] Ha ha ha ha!<br />
[220006030] Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.<br />
[220006040] I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[220007000] Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.<br />
[220007010] I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.<br />
[220007020] Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220007030] And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.<br />
[220007040] I'd heard whispers of such festivities before...<br />
[220007050] Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!<br />
[220007060] Ha ha ha ha!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[220008000] I see. More's the pity.<br />
[220008010] No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.<br />
[220008020] Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[220009000] Ah, what's that look, good sir?<br />
[220009001] Ah, what's that look, good lady?<br />
[220009010] Are you willing to help me out after all?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[220010000] Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.<br />
[220010010] I'll pop clean out. I'm sure, of it!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[220011000] Don't stop now, friend.<br />
[220011010] Just keeping clobbering away at the old behind!<br />
[220011020] Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained.<br />
[220011030] Give it your all, I say!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[220012000] G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face!<br />
[220012010] Smack me from the other end! The other end!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[220013000] I'm heading eastward.<br />
[220013010] To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220013020] I've heard there's to be a festival held there.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[220014000] G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my lid!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[220020000] Oh, I hadn't expected to see your face again.<br />
[220020010] Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?<br />
[220020020] Oh, no need to be coy with me.<br />
[220020030] Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.<br />
[220020040] The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!<br />
[220020050] Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220020060] But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.<br />
[220020070] I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.<br />
[220020080] It seems my calculations must have been off...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[220021000] I was created to be a warrior vessel.<br />
[220021010] Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.<br />
[220021020] It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.<br />
[220021030] It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.<br />
[220021040] And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!<br />
[220021050] What do you think, eh? How do you rate my chances?<br />
[220021060] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[220022000] Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.<br />
[220022010] Are you travelling my way?<br />
[220022020] I'm heading to the festival at Redmane Castle, on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220022030] Oh, no need to be coy with me.<br />
[220022040] I can tell from your bearing you're skilled in the arts of combat.<br />
[220022050] Ah, yes, the mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!<br />
[220022060] I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.<br />
[220022070] And according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220022080] But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.<br />
[220022090] I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.<br />
[220022100] It seems my calculations must have been off...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[220030000] ...!<br />
[220030010] Good sir, where did you spring from?<br />
[220030011] Good lady, where did you spring from?<br />
[220030020] This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.<br />
[220030030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air!<br />
[220030040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220030050] I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend.<br />
[220030060] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[220031000] ...!<br />
[220031010] The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from?<br />
[220031020] This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.<br />
[220031030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air!<br />
[220031040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220031050] Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped!<br />
[220031060] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[220032000] ...!<br />
[220032010] Where did you spring from?<br />
[220032020] This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.<br />
[220032030] What's going on here? A door, from thin air!<br />
[220032040] Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go.<br />
[220032050] I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.<br />
[220032060] I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220032070] Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end!<br />
[220032080] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[220033000] It's time I set off.<br />
[220033010] To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.<br />
[220033020] Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[220040000] Ah, you came, how delightful!<br />
[220040010] Indeed, I thought I might find you here.<br />
[220040020] By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held?<br />
[220040030] Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!<br />
[220040040] To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...<br />
[220040050] In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.<br />
[220040060] But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!<br />
[220040070] Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.<br />
[220040080] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[220041000] Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.<br />
[220041010] I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine.<br />
[220041020] Do you know for whom this festival is being held?<br />
[220041030] Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!<br />
[220041040] To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...<br />
[220041050] In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.<br />
[220041060] But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!<br />
[220041070] Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.<br />
[220041080] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[220042000] Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.<br />
[220042010] I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[220050000] A-ah, hello there.<br />
[220050010] It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.<br />
[220050020] I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock.<br />
[220050030] One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out...<br />
[220050040] After that, I hid like a coward.<br />
[220050050] And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[220051000] ...But don't you think I've given up just yet.<br />
[220051010] As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.<br />
[220051020] If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.<br />
[220051030] And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.<br />
[220051040] Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!<br />
[220051050] Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!<br />
[220051060] Just you wait, when next we meet!<br />
[220051070] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[220052000] Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey.<br />
[220052010] You'll all be inside me, and be part of me.<br />
[220052020] From now on, we're all in it together.<br />
[220052030] So let's all of us dream big.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[220053000] The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.<br />
[220053010] Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!<br />
[220053020] Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!<br />
[220053030] Just you wait, when next we meet!<br />
[220053040] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[220060000] Hello-o? Can you hear me?<br />
[220060010] Help me! I'm stuck!<br />
[220060020] Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[220061000] Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!<br />
[220061010] As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole.<br />
[220061020] Would you mind helping me out, again?<br />
[220061030] My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job!<br />
[220061031] My thanks in advance, I know you're the woman for the job!<br />
[220061040] You know what to do, hm?<br />
[220061050] Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.<br />
[220061060] Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.<br />
[220061070] I'm stuck back together good and proper!<br />
[220061080] Just give it your all!  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[220062000] Ah!<br />
[220062010] Ouuch!  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[220063000] P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this!<br />
[220063010] Would you stop hitting me for a minute!  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[220064000] I see. More's the pity.<br />
[220064010] No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.<br />
[220064020] Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[220065000] What's that look, good sir?<br />
[220065001] What's that look, good lady?<br />
[220065010] Are you willing to help me out after all?  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[220066000] Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[220067000] I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.<br />
[220067010] I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.<br />
[220067020] Hmm...<br />
[220067030] Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...<br />
[220067040] What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?  </p>
<h4>Section 68</h4>
<p>[220068000] Hmm...<br />
[220068010] Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...<br />
[220068020] What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?  </p>
<h4>Section 69</h4>
<p>[220069000] Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!<br />
[220069010] As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in a hole.<br />
[220069020] Would you mind helping me out?  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[220070000] Ngh!<br />
[220070010] Nngh!<br />
[220070020] Oh, yes!<br />
[220070030] That's the ticket!  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[220071000] Nnngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[220072000] My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits.<br />
[220072010] As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[220073000] Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad!<br />
[220073010] There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually.<br />
[220073020] And now I know what it's like to be one of them!<br />
[220073030] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[220074000] Yes, indeed, I too have a home.<br />
[220074010] Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.<br />
[220074020] So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...<br />
[220074030] Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole.<br />
[220074040] I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness.<br />
[220074050] To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!<br />
[220074060] I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.<br />
[220074070] I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.<br />
[220074080] I will forge myself anew in its flames!  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[220075000] I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.<br />
[220075010] I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.<br />
[220075020] I will forge myself anew in its flames!  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[220080000] Ngh!<br />
[220080010] Rnnngh!<br />
[220080020] O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!<br />
[220080030] Rrrrngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[220081000] Nnngh!<br />
[220081010] Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?<br />
[220081011] Ah, good lady, what business might you have in such a place as this?<br />
[220081020] I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours.<br />
[220081030] Your timing though, is impeccable as ever!<br />
[220081040] I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here.<br />
[220081050] Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee.<br />
[220081060] But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here.<br />
[220081070] I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again.<br />
[220081080] Perhaps I'll head eastward.<br />
[220081090] There's an old saying I've caught wind of.<br />
[220081100] "Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[220083000] Perhaps I'll head eastward.<br />
[220083010] There's an old saying I've caught wind of.<br />
[220083020] "Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[220090000] Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.<br />
[220090010] The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.<br />
[220090020] But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh.<br />
[220090030] I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god...<br />
[220090040] Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.<br />
[220090050] Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.<br />
[220090060] Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?<br />
[220090070] Come and tell me when you're ready.<br />
[220090080] I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[220091000] You are ready then, I take it?<br />
[220091010] Then let us begin!<br />
[220091020] I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander!<br />
[220091030] Lend me strength, O warriors within!<br />
[220091040] Let us become one champion, together!  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[220092000] Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.<br />
[220092010] The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.<br />
[220092020] But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god...<br />
[220092030] I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same.<br />
[220092040] Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.<br />
[220092050] Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.<br />
[220092060] Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?<br />
[220092070] Come and tell me when you're ready.<br />
[220092080] I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.  </p>
<h3>2201</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[220100000] As I suspected... Victory...was impossible.<br />
[220100010] This vessel...was found lacking...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[220101000] My thanks. I knew you were the stuff of champions.<br />
[220101010] It was a marvellous battle.<br />
[220101020] I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me...<br />
[220101030] All vessels are destined to one day break.<br />
[220101040] But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last!<br />
[220101050] Ha ha ha ha!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[220102000] Good sir, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.<br />
[220102001] Good lady, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[220130000] By the gods you are a man of vision!<br />
[220130001] By the gods you are a woman of vision!<br />
[220130010] This will have me as slippery as a toad.<br />
[220130020] I have a good feeling about this, my friend.<br />
[220130030] Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[220131000] Argh! Cease! Please!<br />
[220131010] Just stop a moment, I beg!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[220132000] My lower half is stuck on something down there!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[220133000] I'll break! I'll break before I'm out!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[220134000] Argh! No!<br />
[220134010] Stop, please!<br />
[220134020] I beg! I beg of you!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[220135000] Argh!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[220140000] Phew.<br />
[220140010] I thought I was apt to split in half...<br />
[220140020] Mm, I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.<br />
[220140030] I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.<br />
[220140040] Hmm...<br />
[220140050] Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...<br />
[220140060] W-what if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[220141000] My thanks! A thousand thanks!<br />
[220141010] Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.<br />
[220141020] And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!<br />
[220141030] Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.<br />
[220141040] I'm stuck back together good and proper!<br />
[220141050] Just give it your all!  </p>
<h3>2208</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[220800000] Ngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[220801000] What are you playing at?<br />
[220801010] This is no time for games!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[220802000] Wait, I see. I see it now.<br />
[220802010] Humans all lose their wits, eventually.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[220803000] Then there's nothing left to say, except...<br />
[220803010] I am Iron Fist Alexander!<br />
[220803020] The great jar warrior!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[220810000] A finer battle was never witnessed.<br />
[220810010] How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[220820000] How could this...<br />
[220820010] Was my whole existence... just a crock?  </p>
<h3>2209</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[220900000]  <br />
[220900010]  <br />
[220900020]    </p>
<h3>2210</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[221001000] ...  </p>
<h3>Demi-Human Boc [2230]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[223001000] Oi! You there!<br />
[223001010] Could you help us out, cully?<br />
[223001020] You, yeah, you there!<br />
[223001030] Stop pretending you can't see me!<br />
[223001040] Why won't anyone look me in the eye?<br />
[223001050] I-I'm not that ugly, am I?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[223002000] Ow!<br />
[223002010] What'd you go and do that for!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[223003000] Hm? Oh, yes, I remember.<br />
[223003010] Some clod turned me into a tree.<br />
[223003020] You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.<br />
[223003030] Thank you. The name's Boc.<br />
[223003040] I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.<br />
[223003050] Then I ended up as a tree.<br />
[223003060] Lucky you came along, really.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[223004000] Oh, what a shame.<br />
[223004010] When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned,<br />
[223004020] and so this is all I have to express my thanks.<br />
[223004030] I hope you can forgive me.<br />
[223004040] Or, if you can afford to wait for a while,<br />
[223004050] I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.<br />
[223004060] Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[223005000] Right, but I'll need a moment.<br />
[223005010] I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.<br />
[223005020] My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[223010000] Oh, what are you doing here?<br />
[223010010] You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.<br />
[223010020] You'll end up just like me.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[223011000] Wait, is that what I think it is?<br />
[223011010] You got it back for me? My sewing needle!<br />
[223011020] <sob><br />
[223011030] What made you go and do a thing like that...<br />
[223011040] My mum was a seamstress...<br />
[223011050] ...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by.<br />
[223011060] I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.<br />
[223011070] Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[223012000] Thank you.<br />
[223012010] You're very kind.<br />
[223012020] I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum.<br />
[223012030] Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[223013000] Oh..<br />
[223013010] It...hurts...<br />
[223013020] Ooh...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[223020000] Good to see you! Master.<br />
[223020010] Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human.<br />
[223020020] You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.<br />
[223020030] Please, master.<br />
[223020040] Allow me to serve you, as your seamster.<br />
[223020050] I can't make nothing from scratch, but…<br />
[223020060] I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[223021000] Boc the seamster, at your service, Master.<br />
[223021010] Ready to make adjustments to your garments.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[223022000] Oh, going so soon?<br />
[223022010] Please, do be safe on your journeys.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[223023000] Master, I was wondering...<br />
[223023010] Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself?<br />
[223023020] I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please.<br />
[223023030] I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well...<br />
[223023040] I am your personal seamster, after all!<br />
[223023050] I am your personal seamster, after all!  </p>

<p>[223030000] Master, my apologies.<br />
[223030010] Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods,<br />
[223030020] and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.<br />
[223030030] My mum told me once.<br />
[223030040] That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.<br />
[223030050] Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[223031000] Is that a gift for my undeserving self?<br />
[223031010] Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it...<br />
[223031020] Oh!<br />
[223031030] Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life!<br />
[223031040] With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...<br />
[223031050] Are you certain that this is for me?<br />
[223031060] Oh, I can hardly believe it.<br />
[223031070] Have faith in me, Master!<br />
[223031080] I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!<br />
[223031090] I'll be the golden seamster, Boc!<br />
[223031100] Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[223032000] Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew?<br />
[223032010] That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now.<br />
[223032020] Oh, it's still not enough.<br />
[223032030] I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[223040000] Master, may I ask you something?<br />
[223040010] Would you mind if I called you lord?<br />
[223040020] I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.<br />
[223040030] Well, I know that you will be the one,<br />
[223040040] and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for.<br />
[223040050] So, please, if you would.<br />
[223040060] Allow me to call you lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[223041000] You don't say! Thank you, thank you!<br />
[223041010] M'lord, m'lord, m'lord!<br />
[223041020] Please, become Elden Lord.<br />
[223041030] And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[223042000] No, and why would you...<br />
[223042010] Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[223043000] Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord.<br />
[223043010] Ready to make adjustments to your garments.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[223044000] Going already, m'lord?<br />
[223044010] Please, do be safe on your journeys.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[223045000] Master, did you see it?<br />
[223045010] Th-the Erdtree?<br />
[223045020] I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...<br />
[223045030] But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.<br />
[223045040] The Erdtree is waiting for you, master.<br />
[223045050] I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[223046000] M'lord, did you see it?<br />
[223046010] Th-the Erdtree?<br />
[223046020] I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...<br />
[223046030] But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.<br />
[223046040] The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord.<br />
[223046050] I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.<br />
[223046060] O please, take the throne of Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[223050000] M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again?<br />
[223050010] Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria<br />
[223050020] has the power to help people be reborn.<br />
[223050030] Oh? Me? Reborn?<br />
[223050040] Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly...<br />
[223050050] well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[223051000] M'lord, what's this?<br />
[223051010] Oh! Oh!<br />
[223051020] It can't be… For my rebirth?<br />
[223051030] But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me?<br />
[223051040] Oh...<br />
[223051050] M'lord, how did you know?<br />
[223051060] It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[223052000] M'lord, it shouldn't take me long.<br />
[223052010] I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[223052020] I'll be reborn, fresh and new.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[223053000] M'lord.<br />
[223053010] In all honesty, what do you think of me?<br />
[223053020] Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?<br />
[223053030] Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?<br />
[223053040] Oh, I'm such a fool.<br />
[223053050] I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[223054000] Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again?  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[223055000] Master, what's this?<br />
[223055050] Master, how did you know?  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[223056000] Master, it shouldn't take me long.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[223057000] Master.<br />
[223057020] Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[223060000] Did I just hear my mum speaking?<br />
[223060010] Thank you very much.<br />
[223060020] Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.<br />
[223060030] And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice.<br />
[223060040] Please, if I may dream, just once...<br />
[223060050] Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord?<br />
[223060060] Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[223061000] <sob><br />
[223061010] M'lord, my dear lord...<br />
[223061020] I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.<br />
[223061030] May the throne of Elden Lord be yours.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[223062000] No, why on earth would you...<br />
[223062010] It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.<br />
[223062020] But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.<br />
[223062030] One day, I'll look every bit the servant.  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[223065000] Did I just hear my mum speaking?<br />
[223065010] Thank you very much.<br />
[223065020] Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.<br />
[223065030] And now, my kind master let me hear her voice.<br />
[223065040] Please, if I may dream, just once...<br />
[223065050] Do you feel the same way my mum did, master?<br />
[223065060] Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[223066000] <sob><br />
[223066010] Master, kind master...<br />
[223066020] I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[223067000] No, why on earth would you...<br />
[223067010] It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.<br />
[223067020] But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.<br />
[223067030] One day, I'll look every bit the servant.  </p>
<h3>Boc the Seamster [2231]</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[223100000] S-surely, not? For me?!<br />
[223100010] Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me.<br />
[223100020] You should drink it yourself, master.<br />
[223100030] I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>

[223102010] O-oh...<br />

<p>[223800000] Ow!<br />
[223800010] Why'd you go and do that?<br />
[223800020] It's because I'm ugly, isn't it?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[223801000] Oh, now, you too, is it?<br />
[223801010] The story of my rotten life...<br />
[223801020] Ah...aaah!  </p>

<p>[223802000] No...<br />
[223802010] I never wanted this...  </p>

[223810010] M-master?<br />

<p>[223811000] Master, what's happened...<br />

<h3>War Counselor Iji [2240]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[224001000] Well, look at you. We don't receive many visitors.<br />
[224001010] I presume you are a Tarnished. What brings you here?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[224010000] Oh, pardon me. It's hardly my place to ask, is it.<br />
[224010010] I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals…<br />
[224010020] An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer.<br />
[224010030] So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot.<br />
[224010040] Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[224011000] Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again.<br />
[224011010] Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[224012000] Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again?  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[224013000] Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please.<br />
[224013010] This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.<br />
[224013020] When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.<br />
[224013030] After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.<br />
[224013040] The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...<br />
[224013050] By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.<br />
[224013060] That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.<br />
[224013070] Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[224014000] Oh, watch out, there.<br />
[224014010] When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.<br />
[224014020] If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.<br />
[224014030] I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished.<br />
[224014040] You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[224015000] Something else for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[224016000] I've explained the peril.<br />
[224016010] Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor.<br />
[224016020] Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[224017000] Blaidd actually did that, did he?<br />
[224017010] Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he.<br />
[224017020] Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you.<br />
[224017030] At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd,<br />
[224017040] I've a few more things that might suit you.<br />
[224017050] I've something else that might suit you.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[224020000] Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.<br />
[224020040] Again, I am Iji.<br />
[224020050] The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.<br />
[224020060] I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.<br />
[224020070] I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[224023020] The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.<br />
[224023030] I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.<br />
[224023040] I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[224024000] Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.<br />
[224024010] The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[224030000] I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella?<br />
[224030010] Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City.<br />
[224030020] After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron.<br />
[224030030] By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.<br />
[224030040] Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city.<br />
[224030050] Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped.<br />
[224030060] To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[224031000] Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother.<br />
[224031010] Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.<br />
[224031020] They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.<br />
[224031030] When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean,<br />
[224031040] Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals,<br />
[224031050] but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together.<br />
[224031060] Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you?<br />
[224031070] The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[224032000] Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.<br />
[224032010] Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.<br />
[224032020] An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.<br />
[224032030] No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.<br />
[224032040] Oh, no, wait...<br />
[224032050] How did I not see it before!<br />
[224032060] I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!<br />
[224032070] Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.<br />
[224032080] As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.<br />
[224032090] But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.<br />
[224032100] Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.<br />
[224032110] And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
[224032120] As would Lady Ranni's destiny.<br />
[224032130] Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[224033000] My apologies for the misleading words of warning.<br />
[224033010] I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.<br />
[224033020] I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.<br />
[224033030] Do forgive me, my fellow.<br />
[224033040] Let us give all that we can of ourselves.<br />
[224033050] Together, for Lady Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[224034000] Let us give all that we can of ourselves.<br />
[224034010] Together, for Lady Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[224035000] Let us give all that we can of ourselves.<br />
[224035010] Together, for Lady Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[224036000] Well, my fellow. How may I serve you?<br />
[224036010] As war counsellor, or as blacksmith?  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[224037000] Greetings, my fellow. How can I help?  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[224038000] Something else for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[224039000] Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.<br />
[224039010] Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
[224039020] Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[224040000] Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.<br />
[224040010] You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.<br />
[224040020] The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.<br />
[224040030] There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.<br />
[224040040] Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.<br />
[224040050] Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
[224040060] And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[224041000] Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.<br />
[224041010] Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.<br />
[224041020] Blaidd has been given an important task.<br />
[224041030] Apparently, a matter of great urgency.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[224042000] You need not await Blaidd.<br />
[224042010] Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
[224042020] And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.<br />
[224042030] So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[224050000] Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated...<br />
[224050010] Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.<br />
[224050020] Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.<br />
[224050030] Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.<br />
[224050040] With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...<br />
[224050050] Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[224051000] Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.<br />
[224051010] Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.<br />
[224051020] An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.<br />
[224051030] It's funny how things happen.<br />
[224051040] Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.<br />
[224051050] I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[224060000] I presume you've spoken with Blaidd?<br />
[224060010] Very well. There is something you should know.<br />
[224060020] The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.<br />
[224060030] But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,<br />
[224060040] the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.<br />
[224060050] But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.<br />
[224060060] It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[224070000] Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...<br />
[224070010] How did he break free from his cell?<br />
[224070020] No, more importantly...<br />
[224070030] Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.<br />
[224070040] I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...<br />
[224070050] I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.<br />
[224070060] When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology.  </p>
<h3>2241</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[224100000] Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.<br />
[224100010] You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.<br />
[224100020] A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.<br />
[224100030] Again, I am Iji.<br />
[224100040] The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.<br />
[224100050] I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[224101000] Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.<br />
[224101010] Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
[224101020] And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.<br />
[224101030] So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[224102000] Oh, so you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.<br />

[224102050] I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[224150000] Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop by.<br />
[224150010] Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.<br />
[224150020] Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.<br />
[224150030] It would not have been possible without you.<br />
[224150040] As Lady Ranni's war counsellor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude.<br />
[224150050] You, and only you, were Lady Ranni's true champion.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[224151000] My purpose is nearing its end.<br />
[224151010] I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...<br />
[224151020] It has been a long and wondrous journey.<br />
[224151030] Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.<br />
[224151040] I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[224152000] Well, what's this?<br />
[224152010] Are you certain? This is a fine reserve.<br />
[224152020] Perhaps you knew that Old Iji appreciates a good drink.<br />
[224152030] I'll save it for a quiet moment, that I might truly savour it.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[224153000] Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.<br />

<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[226002000] Gosh, truly? That's wonderful news!<br />
[226002010] It's not easy being Potentate, though.<br />

[226004070] The flowers we have now are nice, but it's a bit boring having the same ones all the time.<br />

<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[226051000] I don't know, I'm a little disappointed actually.<br />
[226051010] Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour...<br />
[226051020] He says he isn't a warrior.<br />
[226051030] And since he's a coward, he won't be fighting anymore.<br />
[226051040] His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us.<br />

[226802010] Is this who you are, coz?<br />
[226802020] You've cracked my heart.<br />
[226802030] Please, don't crack the others...<br />
[226802040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[226803000] You were a poacher, all along.<br />
[226803001] You were a poacher, all along.<br />
[226803010] You were a poacher, all along.<br />
[226803020] You've cracked my heart.<br />
[226803030] Please, don't crack the others...<br />
[226803040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[226804000] So, you were a poacher, too.<br />
[226804001] So, you were a poacher, too.<br />
[226804010] So, you were a poacher, too.<br />
[226804020] But the tale of house Hoslow is told in blood.<br />
[226804030] I'll find you, one day, coz...<br />
[226804031] I'll find you, one day, coz...<br />

<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[227001000] Sister... Where did you go?<br />
[227001010] You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars...<br />
[227001020] I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever, it seems.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[227002000] Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here.<br />
[227002010] No time to waste. Let's see the stars.  </p>
<h3>Latenna the Albinauric [2280]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[228001000] Foul Tarnished, what do you want?<br />
[228001010] I told the all-hearing brute.<br />
[228001020] That I possess no such medallion.<br />
[228001030] Or have you come to take more from me?<br />
[228001040] Was my other half not enough?<br />
[228001050] I told the bastard in the bone armour.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[228002000] I told the all-hearing brute already.<br />
[228002010] That I possess no such medallion.<br />
[228002020] Or have you come to take more from me?<br />
[228002030] Was my other half not enough?<br />
[228002040] I told the bastard in bone armour already.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[228010000] Oh...do you speak true?<br />
[228010010] So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you.<br />
[228010020] ...<br />
[228010030] Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will.<br />
[228010040] Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus.<br />
[228010050] My apologies for my coarse words earlier.<br />
[228010060] I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute.<br />
[228010070] I hope that you will forgive me.<br />
[228010080] I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like the bastard before.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[228011000] Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway.<br />
[228011010] Would you consider doing me a great service?<br />
[228011020] I must go back.<br />
[228011030] There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo.<br />
[228011040] Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree.<br />
[228011050] If you accept, I would gladly apprise you.<br />
[228011060] Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[228012000] Thank you kindly.<br />
[228012010] They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.<br />
[228012020] In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[228013000] Then I suppose it's time.<br />
[228013010] Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.<br />
[228013020] I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.<br />
[228013030] Forgive me, Lobo.<br />
[228013040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[228014000] Call upon me when needed.<br />
[228014010] And I will fight at your side.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[228015000] Well...<br />
[228015010] I understand. You must have your own duty to fulfil.<br />
[228015020] But please, allow me to say my piece.<br />
[228015030] Even if you cannot take me, old Albus wished I relay to you the following:<br />
[228015040] The other half of the medallion can be found beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.<br />
[228015050] In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[228016000] If you seek the other half of the medallion, they say it's beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.<br />
[228016010] In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[228017000] My thanks...<br />
[228017010] You'll lead me then, to the land of Miquella's Haligtree.<br />
[228017020] Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.<br />
[228017030] I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.<br />
[228017040] Forgive me, Lobo.<br />
[228017050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[228018000] Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.<br />
[228018010] We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north,<br />
[228018020] where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[228019000] Castle Sol lies just off to the north,<br />
[228019010] where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[228020000] Oh young yet towering sister of ours.<br />
[228020010] Let the birthing droplet in.<br />
[228020020] And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[228021000] Thank you.<br />
[228021010] I've finally fulfilled my purpose.<br />
[228021020] Our young yet towering sister will give us hope.<br />
[228021030] Now that nothing is left unfinished,<br />
[228021040] I will join you in battle to the bitter end.<br />
[228021050] And when the fighting is done,<br />
[228021060] then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf.<br />
[228021070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[228030000] Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.<br />
[228030010] We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels.<br />
[228030020] It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home.<br />
[228030030] These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.<br />
[228030040] And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,<br />
[228030050] lies the place to which I must return.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[228031000] We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree.<br />

<p>[228802000] Are all you Tarnished the same?<br />
[228802010] Was taking my other half not enough for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[228803000] There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty.  </p>

<h3>Tanith, Volcano Manor Proprietress [3000]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[300001000] Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor.<br />
[300001010] I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house.<br />
[300001020] Rya spoke well of you.<br />
[300001030] "A warrior of promise," I believe she said.<br />
[300001040] Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment.<br />
[300001050] Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide?<br />
[300001060] Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?<br />
[300001070] Rise with us, against the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[300002000] Interesting. Your decision is most welcome.<br />
[300002010] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.<br />
[300002020] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.<br />
[300002030] But be sure to earn your keep.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[300003000] Well. That is unfortunate.<br />
[300003010] Rya will be disappointed, but I won't twist your arm.<br />
[300003020] Now, time for you to leave, I should think.<br />
[300003030] Let this intersection of our paths be the last.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[300004000] Aren't you precocious.<br />
[300004010] We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation.<br />
[300004020] Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago…<br />
[300004030] So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts?<br />
[300004040] About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?<br />
[300004050] If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us?<br />
[300004060] Rise with us, against the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[300005000] Your decision is most welcome.<br />
[300005010] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.<br />
[300005020] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.<br />
[300005030] I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[300006000] Well. That is unfortunate.<br />
[300006010] Now, time for you to leave, I should think.<br />
[300006020] Let this intersection of our paths be the last.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[300007000] Did you read the letter left for you?<br />
[300007010] That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.<br />
[300007020] You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.<br />
[300007030] If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it.<br />
[300007040] But you must leave this house at once.<br />
[300007050] This is a war against the Erdtree.<br />
[300007060] We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[300008000] What's this?<br />
[300008010] Have you reconsidered the prospect?<br />
[300008020] Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[300009000] Very well.<br />
[300009010] Your decision is most welcome.<br />
[300009020] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.<br />
[300009030] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[300010000] You've completed your task.<br />
[300010010] I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.<br />
[300010020] This is your reward, as promised.<br />
[300010030] Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion.<br />
[300010040] The way is tainted, but for this very reason,<br />
[300010050] it is the true path to valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[300012000] I see you've performed another task for us.<br />
[300012010] Here is your usual reward. Please, take it.<br />
[300012020] Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you.<br />
[300012030] Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.<br />
[300012040] The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.<br />
[300012050] But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task.<br />
[300012060] The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.<br />
[300012070] Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.<br />
[300012080] Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.<br />
[300012090] If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,<br />
[300012100] then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.<br />
[300012110] We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.<br />
[300012120] If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.<br />
[300012130] The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.<br />
[300012140] It cannot come a day too soon!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[300013000] The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.<br />
[300013010] You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[300014000] If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.<br />
[300014010] It cannot come a day too soon!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[300021000] She said that, to you?<br />
[300021010] I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough.<br />
[300021020] Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.<br />
[300021030] That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.<br />
[300021040] Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself.<br />
[300021050] What matters one's lineage in such a crisis?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[300022000] No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere.<br />
[300022010] And she has no scouting duties now.<br />
[300022020] Has she gone off in search of answers?<br />
[300022030] Why won't she just listen...  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[300023000] May I ask your aid?<br />
[300023010] Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother.<br />
[300023020] If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress,<br />
[300023030] have her drink this potion.<br />
[300023040] To purge that which would cause her pain.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[300024000] Yes, I know.<br />
[300024010] My wish is a grave disrespect to her.<br />
[300024020] No different than the Erdtree's imposition.<br />
[300024030] But I've no choice... It must be done.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[300025000] Thank you, for allowing me this.<br />
[300025010] I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail.<br />
[300025020] Our Lord must have known this all along.<br />
[300025030] My meekness is all too clear...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[300026000] Really, she is dead, then...<br />
[300026010] My gratitude for your forthrightness.<br />
[300026020] If you would...allow me some time alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[300029000] Please, allow me some time alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[300030000] I see that you've stayed the path of champions.<br />
[300030010] This is your usual reward. Please, take it.<br />
[300030020] Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord?<br />
[300030030] Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[300031000] Yes, as it should be.<br />
[300031010] Now, close your eyes for a moment.<br />
[300031020] I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.<br />
[300031030] Farewell, then.<br />
[300031040] May your visit be fruitful.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[300032000] I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap.<br />
[300032010] But do know this.<br />
[300032020] To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential.<br />
[300032030] In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree.<br />
[300032040] Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[300033000] Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord?<br />
[300033010] Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[300040000] You...<br />
[300040010] It's true then. You've defeated our Lord.<br />
[300040020] No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that.<br />
[300040030] Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger.<br />
[300040040] Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[300041000] I will leave the Volcano Manor before long.<br />
[300041010] I suggest you do the same.<br />
[300041020] Here is my thanks. For allowing our Lord to be revived, even stronger than before.<br />
[300041030] I will miss these encounters.<br />
[300041040] The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more.<br />
[300041050] I always was an admirer.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[300050000] Oh, you...<br />
[300050010] Allow me some time.<br />
[300050020] Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed.<br />
[300050030] Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,<br />
[300050040] I wish to be your serpent; your family.<br />
[300050050] One day, let us devour the gods together.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[300051000] Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,<br />
[300051010] I wish to be your serpent; your family.<br />
[300051020] One day, let us devour the gods together.  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[300076000] Now, time for you to leave, I should think.<br />
[300076010] Let this intersection of our paths be the last.  </p>
<h4>Section 77</h4>
<p>[300077000] The drawing room is through the hall.<br />
[300077010] Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.  </p>
<h4>Section 78</h4>
<p>[300078000] What's this?<br />
[300078010] Have you reconsidered the prospect?<br />
[300078020] Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?  </p>
<h4>Section 79</h4>
<p>[300079000] Very well.<br />
[300079010] Your decision is most welcome.<br />
[300079020] Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.<br />
[300079030] The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[300080000] Now, time for you to leave, I should think.<br />
[300080010] Let this intersection of our paths be the last.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[300081000] The drawing room is through the hall.<br />
[300081010] Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[300082000] Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.<br />
[300082010] I am pleased to have you on our side.  </p>
<h3>3001</h3>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[300110000] Did you see her?<br />
[300110010] The girl, Rya…with her true face.<br />
[300110020] ...<br />
[300110030] Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas,<br />
[300110040] then perhaps it is not my place to speak.<br />
[300110050] But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you.<br />
[300110060] Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.<br />
[300110070] Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.<br />
[300110080] …Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[300111000] Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.<br />
[300111010] Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[300112000] Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.<br />
[300112010] That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[300113000] My wish is a grave disrespect to her.<br />
[300113010] But I've no choice... It must be done.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[300114000] Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?  </p>
<h3>3002</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[300200000] This is farewell.<br />
[300200010] Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[300201000] What is it?<br />
[300201010] I have no need of that.<br />
[300201020] I must continue devouring my beloved lord...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[300202000] Oh, you...<br />
[300202010] Allow me some time.<br />
[300202020] Our lord's carcass is not easily consumed.  </p>
<h3>3008</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[300800000]  <br />
[300800010]    </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[300801000] Ngh!<br />
[300801010] Ahh, my lord...<br />
[300801020] Rykard...  </p>
<h3>3009</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[300900000] Oh, Rykard…<br />
[300900010] Let me be your serpent…  </p>
<h3>White Mask Varré [3010]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[301001000] Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?<br />
[301001010] Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?<br />
[301001020] Of course you have. No shame in it.<br />
[301001030] But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck.<br />
[301001040] You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes.<br />
[301001050] Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[301002000] Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament?<br />
[301002010] It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot.<br />
[301002020] Fine, then.<br />
[301002030] If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education.<br />
[301002040] On the ways of the learned Tarnished.<br />
[301002050] Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.<br />
[301002060] You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.<br />
[301002070] That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.<br />
[301002080] It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you,<br />
[301002090] maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[301003000] What's the matter?<br />
[301003010] Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such?<br />
[301003020] Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace.<br />
[301003030] To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff.<br />
[301003040] And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,<br />
[301003050] you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[301004000] Guidance will show the way, most certainly.<br />
[301004010] To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.<br />
[301004020] The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.<br />
[301004030] Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm.<br />
[301004040] Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless.<br />
[301004050] Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,<br />
[301004060] you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[301011000] Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?<br />
[301011010] Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?<br />
[301011020] Of course you have. No shame in it.<br />
[301011030] Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.<br />
[301011040] Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold...<br />
[301011050] You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[301012000] Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless.<br />
[301012010] Me. Varré. Take care to listen.<br />
[301012020] Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.<br />
[301012030] You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.<br />
[301012040] That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.<br />
[301012050] Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers.<br />
[301012060] It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.<br />
[301012070] Even if it leads you to your grave.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[301013000] Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.<br />
[301013010] To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.<br />
[301013020] The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[301014000] It's time you set off, I should think.<br />
[301014010] To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.<br />
[301014020] If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[301020000] Ohh, well done, well done indeed.<br />
[301020010] You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.<br />
[301020020] And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold… My sincerest congratulations.<br />
[301020030] But, how did you find the Roundtable?<br />
[301020040] Oh, you don't have to say it.<br />
[301020050] Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.<br />
[301020060] I fear you've been terribly disappointed.<br />
[301020070] I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks.<br />
[301020080] Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[301021000] Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.<br />
[301021010] To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience...<br />
[301021020] ...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.<br />
[301021030] They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.<br />
[301021040] Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[301022000] Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.<br />
[301022010] Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune.<br />
[301022020] Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft...<br />
[301022030] So. Prepare for the worst.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[301023000] ...<br />
[301023010] Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well.<br />
[301023020] Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided.<br />
[301023030] But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways,<br />
[301023040] I'm always willing to hear you out.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[301024000] Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper?  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[301025000] What's the matter?<br />
[301025010] Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold?<br />
[301025020] Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil,<br />
[301025030] for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience.<br />
[301025040] With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[301026000] Ohh, well done, well done indeed.<br />
[301026010] You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune.<br />
[301026020] You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune.<br />
[301026030] My congratulations.<br />
[301026040] Now, visit the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[301026050] For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[301027000] Go to the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[301027010] For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[301030000] Ah, there you are.<br />
[301030010] You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[301030020] You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[301030030] What was your impression?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[301031000] Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well.<br />
[301031010] My doubts had been piling up, you see.<br />
[301031020] ...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted.<br />
[301031030] Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions.<br />
[301031040] I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed.<br />
[301031050] Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind.<br />
[301031060] That's the part that irks the most.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[301032000] Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[301033000] A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers.<br />
[301033010] Give it a try, won't you?<br />
[301033020] And if it please you, may we meet again.<br />
[301033030] I've high hopes for you. My lambkin.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[301034000] You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be.<br />
[301034010] You may go, then. My work here is done.<br />
[301034020] May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[301035000] Oh? Is something wrong?  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[301036000] Be sure to try that finger I gave you.<br />
[301036010] There's no reason to dither.<br />
[301036020] The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world?<br />
[301036030] Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[301037000] Be sure to try that finger I gave you.<br />
[301037010] I'm quite certain that you'll take to it.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[301050000] Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here.<br />
[301050010] I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift.<br />
[301050020] Mmm, I knew it from the very start.<br />
[301050030] You have a taste for noble blood.<br />
[301050040] ...<br />
[301050050] I wish to anoint you a proper inductee.<br />
[301050060] A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty.<br />
[301050070] Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love.<br />
[301050080] So, what do you say, my lambkin?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[301051000] Mm, yes, who would have it any other way?<br />
[301051010] Now, take this.<br />
[301051020] For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood.<br />
[301051030] Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers.<br />
[301051040] But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[301052000] Oh my, perhaps you misheard me.<br />
[301052010] Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two.<br />
[301052020] For your ears to clear out.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[301053000] Oh, it's you.<br />
[301053010] Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[301054000] Ahh, my lambkin.<br />
[301054010] You've completed your final trial.<br />
[301054020] And with this, you are a formal inductee.<br />
[301054030] A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty.<br />
[301054040] Now, give me your finger.<br />
[301054050] This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you.<br />
[301054060] Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.<br />
[301054070] Never forget that feeling of agony.<br />
[301054080] For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us.<br />
[301054090] Ha ha ha...<br />
[301054100] You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[301055000] Oh, another thing. You should have this.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[301056000] A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty.<br />
[301056010] With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg.<br />
[301056020] I've gone out of my way to provide one to you.<br />
[301056030] But you mustn't use it just yet.<br />
[301056040] The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences.<br />
[301056050] Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity.<br />
[301056060] We must endure a little longer.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[301057000] Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient.<br />
[301057010] One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love.<br />
[301057020] Right, my lambkin?<br />
[301057030] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[301058000] The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden.<br />
[301058010] The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[301080000] What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here?<br />
[301080010] Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg?<br />
[301080020] I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this.<br />
[301080030] Before you die in obscurity.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[301081000] You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty?<br />
[301081010] I am pained, to the very depths of my being.<br />
[301081020] I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin.<br />
[301081030] Enjoy your miserable death.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[301082000] How dare you trouble Luminary Mohg's passions.<br />
[301082010] You vulgar churl.  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[301083000] I made a grave error.  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[301084000] Why must I be...<br />
[301084010] Disgraced by this lowborn...  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[301085000] O...Luminary...Mohg...<br />
[301085010] Please grant...the strength...you promised...<br />
[301085020] I have given...everything...<br />
[301085030] Please...my lord...  </p>
<h4>Section 86</h4>
<p>[301086000] Please, answer me...Luminary...Mohg.<br />
[301086010] ...<br />
[301086020] A-ahh...<br />
[301086030] Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!<br />
[301086040] <groan><br />
[301086050] ...  </p>
<h3>3018</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[301800000] Oh?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[301801000] Do you even comprehend?<br />
[301801010] The gravity of this choice.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[301802000] Very well.<br />
[301802010] If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart,<br />
[301802020] then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[301803000] You disappoint me.<br />
[301803010] Perhaps noble blood is too rich for the maidenless.<br />
[301803020] Well, no sense in sparing your life now.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[301804000] You were a maidenless upstart to begin with.<br />
[301804010] You will die nameless, without ceremony.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[301805000] Oh dear, a pity it's come to this, my lambkin.<br />
[301805010] How does it feel to die a failure?<br />
[301805020] Materials of quality are so hard to find, these days...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[301806000] You maidenless runt...<br />
[301806010] Who do you think I am?<br />
[301806020] <groan>  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[301807000] Luminary Mohg...<br />
[301807010] Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!<br />
[301807020] <groan>  </p>
<h3>3019</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[301900000]  <br />
[301900010]  <br />
[301900020]    </p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Gostoc [3020]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[302001000] You there.<br />
[302001010] Come over here, would you?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[302002000] You're Tarnished, aren't you?<br />
[302002010] I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.<br />
[302002020] It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.<br />
[302002030] Try the opening right here.<br />
[302002040] The guards don't know about it.<br />
[302002050] You'll breach the castle undetected.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[302003000] Yes, that's the spirit.<br />
[302003010] ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.<br />
[302003020] I pray for your success.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[302004000] Fair enough, you certainly don't have to trust me.<br />
[302004010] Well, If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.<br />
[302004020] But of course, I'd advise against it.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[302005000] Use that opening to breach the castle.<br />
[302005010] The guards haven't a clue about it.<br />
[302005020] You'll slip right inside undetected.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[302006000] Of course. I understand.<br />
[302006010] When you approach the gates, I'll signal them to open.<br />
[302006020] It's only your neck on the line, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[302007000] The gates! Open the gates!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[302008000] ...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.<br />
[302008010] I pray for your success.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[302009000] The gates are open. Do as you like.<br />
[302009010] It's only your neck on the line, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[302020000] Oh, oh, you...<br />
[302020010] Oh, great, I'm glad you're here.<br />
[302020020] Just a small reward, I was saving it for you.<br />
[302020030] Please, it's all yours.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[302021000] Good, now let's be on our way, shall we?<br />
[302021010] Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[302022000] Hop along, will you?<br />
[302022010] What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[302025000] Rubbish...<br />
[302025010] Another one...another one all skin and bones.<br />
[302025020] ...Worse than a petty squire...<br />
[302025030] ...Ahh, not a muscle on this one either...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[302026000] Oh, you...<br />
[302026010] For god's sake, don't scare me like that!<br />
[302026020] ...<br />
[302026030] What, oh, just clearing out some corpses.<br />
[302026040] Can't just leave them about, you know, they'll start to pong, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[302027000] Oh, hello. No, don't you mind me for a minute.<br />
[302027010] It's my job to keep the grounds clean.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[302028000]    </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[302040000] Oh, hello... Glad to see you safe.<br />
[302040010] I've come into some fine goods.<br />
[302040020] Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them.<br />
[302040030] Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[302041000] Oh, hello, anything you'd care to purchase?  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[302045000] Fare thee well.<br />
[302045010] I pray for your success.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[302050000] What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone.<br />
[302050010] Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you?<br />
[302050020] Look down, on me, would you?<br />
[302050030] Godrick? You filthy slug.<br />
[302050040] Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[302051000] Oh...hello there.<br />
[302051010] This weasel was... Godrick was always looking down on me.<br />
[302051020] He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you.<br />
[302051030] I tell you though, what goes around comes around.<br />
[302051040] He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh.<br />
[302051050] He he he he he...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[302052000] Now, I suppose I'm free.<br />
[302052010] I can do whatever takes my fancy...<br />
[302052020] Can't I, mate?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[302060000] You giving that to me?<br />
[302060010] ...<br />
[302060020] Well, I suppose I did save your life, in a way.<br />
[302060030] I'll gladly take it off your hands. Be rude not to, eh!<br />
[302060040] Mmm, you Tarnished are alright by me.<br />
[302060050] The sweet ones like you, anyway.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[302061000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[302070000] Ah, you, is it?<br />
[302070010] Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.<br />
[302070020] As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.<br />
[302070030] Freedom? Wasn't worth squat.<br />
[302070040] B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...<br />
[302070050] Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance...  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[302071000] Still, I have the Lady's trust.<br />
[302071010] ...So I can loot all the corpses I like.<br />
[302071020] I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[302072000] Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.<br />
[302072010] Well then, what are you after?  </p>
<h3>3028</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[302800000] Ouch!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[302801000] Oi, what're you doing?<br />
[302801010] Stop that!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[302802000] Blast, what's it to you!<br />
[302802010] Step back, you wretched Tarnished!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[302803000] Finally given up the ghost, eh...<br />
[302803010] Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[302804000] Hah! Do you feel it?<br />
[302804010] Do you feel my bloody wrath?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[302805000] Damn it all. Why is it always me...<br />
[302805010] What did I do to deserve...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[302806000] But...I'm free...<br />
[302806010] I can do...what I like...  </p>
<h3>3029</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[302900000]  <br />
[302900010]  <br />
[302900020]    </p>
<h3>3030</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[303001000] Good Lord! Good God of Vengeance!<br />
[303001010] Till grudges soak the lands!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[303002000] Oh...<br />
[303002010] I see, you're Tarnished.<br />
[303002020] I am Guilbert. A Redeemer of vengeance. In all its forms.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[303003000] By the way...<br />
[303003010] Have you heard of the crucible knights?<br />
[303003020] There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him.<br />
[303003030] He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him.<br />
[303003040] The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance.<br />
[303003050] ...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[303004000] These fellows?<br />
[303004010] Who knows, just some lads who did someone wrong.<br />
[303004020] They got what was coming, nothing more.<br />
[303004030] If you're intent on revenge, pray to the God of Vengeance.<br />
[303004040] You'll have yourself a corpse in no time.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[303005000] You're Tarnished. Then you're here to fight, aren't you?<br />
[303005010] For the Elden Ring.<br />
[303005020] Well, there's something you ought to know.<br />
[303005030] There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil.<br />
[303005040] He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished.<br />
[303005050] He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods.<br />
[303005060] ...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[303006000] In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should.<br />
[303006010] They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance.<br />
[303006020] That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves.<br />
[303006030] Like someone did for me, when I...when I was but a tyke.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[303010000] Oh, there you are...<br />
[303010010] It must have been a dream. Strange.<br />
[303010020] I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible.<br />
[303010030] It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance.<br />
[303010040] Heh...<br />
[303010050] Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well...<br />
[303010520] I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[303011000] Ah, you...<br />
[303011010] Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible?<br />
[303011020] I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle.<br />
[303011030] Heh...<br />
[303011040] Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too...<br />
[303011510] Did you defeat Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[303013000] Alright, then.<br />
[303013010] I'm off to Stormveil Castle.<br />
[303013020] Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting...<br />
[303013030] Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood.<br />
[303013040] A demigod, yes, he may be...<br />
[303013050] But no one escapes a Redeemer.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[303014000] I was thinking...<br />
[303014010] Godrick must have an idea.<br />
[303014020] About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath.<br />
[303014030] ...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do...<br />
[303014510] Godrick must know.<br />
[303014920] That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[303015000] Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red...<br />
[303015010] Master Radahn, is this how it feels to ferment with vengeance?<br />
[303015020] I can hardly keep from trembling...  </p>
<h3>3039</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[303900000] Well, well, you've made yourself a target of vengeance.<br />
[303900010] Perhaps this, too, was meant to be.<br />
[303900020] Prepare to become an offering.<br />
[303900030] Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[303901000] Hello there, I don't believe we've met.<br />
[303901010] I'm afraid you've made yourself the object of somebody's ire.<br />
[303901020] As a Redeemer, I'm bound to exact revenge.<br />
[303901030] Prepare to become an offering.<br />
[303901040] Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[303902000] Whoah, what're you playing at? (OKテイク, v303902000_ALT_3)
What're you playing at?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[303903000] ...<br />
[303903010] This is a little awkward.<br />
[303903020] There's no revenge to be had in this killing.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[303904000] Not too sharp, are you?<br />
[303904010] If you want to die, ask someone else.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[303905000]  <br />
[303905100]  <br />
[303905200]    </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[303906000] Let it be known.<br />
[303906010] Wherever vengeance must be had, a Redeemer there will be...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[303907000] Oh, my Lord. Good God of Vengeance!<br />
[303907010] Till grudges soak the lands...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[303908000] Don't you see now?<br />
[303908010] There is no escape from a Redeemer.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[303909000] Death ought to be earned.<br />
[303909010] What am I to make of this?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[303910000] Didn't I tell you before?<br />
[303910010] No one escapes a Redeemer.<br />
[303910020] Prepare to become an offering, once and for all.<br />
[303910030] Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.  </p>
<h3>Preceptor Seluvis [3070]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307001000] I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling.<br />
[307001001] I see... You must be Ranni's new girl.<br />
[307001010] Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.<br />
[307001020] I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.<br />
[307001030] I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,<br />
[307001040] but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,<br />
[307001050] I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[307002000] I reside...in another tower, close by.<br />
[307002010] Come and pay me a visit...<br />
[307002020] Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.<br />
[307002030] If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.<br />
[307002040] But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[307010000] Well, well. You took me at my word.<br />
[307010010] Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...<br />
[307010020] Hmm, I suppose you're here now.<br />
[307010030] Perhaps I'll give you something to do.<br />
[307010040] I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.<br />
[307010050] Even you can do that much, can't you?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[307011000] Good, good.<br />
[307011010] Now I shall hand over the potion in question.<br />
[307011020] Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.<br />
[307011030] I expect glad tidings. And soon.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[307012000] I see...<br />
[307012010] What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are.<br />
[307012020] Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance.<br />
[307012030] If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me.<br />
[307012040] Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not?<br />
[307012050] Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[307013000] Have you fumbled out the correct answer now?<br />
[307013010] Then you will undertake my task?  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[307014000] ...<br />
[307014010] You are peerless in your dullardry.<br />
[307014020] Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence.<br />
[307014030] Don't bother wasting your breath on me again.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[307015000] I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more...<br />
[307015010] Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[307016000] Good, good.<br />
[307016010] As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.<br />
[307016020] Now I shall hand over the potion in question.<br />
[307016030] Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.<br />
[307016040] I expect glad tidings. And soon.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[307017000] I've no time for idle chit chat.<br />
[307017010] The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion.<br />
[307017020] Are we understood? Then off you trot.<br />
[307017030] I have enough on my plate.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[307030000] Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?<br />
[307030010] Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.<br />
[307030011] Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought.<br />
[307030020] Very well. Then you shall have your gift.<br />
[307030030] Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.<br />
[307030040] I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...<br />
[307030050] If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[307031000] You wish to begin right this moment?<br />
[307031010] Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[307032000] Begging for another lesson so soon?<br />
[307032010] There remains much to be done. Make it quick.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[307033000] Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not.<br />
[307033010] Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[307040000] Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?<br />
[307040010] The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?<br />
[307040020] Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.<br />
[307040030] Well...there's no helping it.<br />
[307040040] Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.<br />
[307040050] There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.<br />
[307040060] She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.<br />
[307040070] I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.<br />
[307040080] I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[307041000] So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?<br />
[307041010] Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.<br />
[307041020] It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.<br />
[307041030] I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[307050000] You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?<br />
[307050010] Your oafishness knows no bounds.<br />
[307050020] Fine and well.<br />
[307050030] You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.<br />
[307050040] I believe that makes you my accomplice.<br />
[307050050] You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?<br />
[307050060] Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.<br />
[307050070] But perhaps I can make a very special exception.<br />
[307050080] Now, choose.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[307051000] Ah, I knew you'd see things my way.<br />
[307051010] You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such...<br />
[307051020] You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish.<br />
[307051030] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.<br />
[307051031] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.<br />
[307051040] Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.<br />
[307051050] To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.<br />
[307051060] Now, choose.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[307052000] Well, this is a surprise.<br />
[307052010] But aren't we forgetting something?<br />
[307052020] The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught.<br />
[307052030] You are already my accomplice.<br />
[307052040] Are you ready to change your mind, now?<br />
[307052050] It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[307053000] Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss.<br />
[307053010] Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[307054000] (huge sigh)<br />
[307054010] You truly are beyond salvation.<br />
[307054020] Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again.<br />
[307054030] Ah, what a terrible pity.<br />
[307054040] This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[307055000] I thought I told you never to show your face again.<br />
[307055010] Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology?  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[307056000] Good, good.<br />
[307056010] As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.<br />
[307056020] And well, you finally realised, did you?<br />
[307056030] All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart.<br />
[307056040] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.<br />
[307056041] Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.<br />
[307056050] Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.<br />
[307056060] To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.<br />
[307056070] Now, choose.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[307060000] How's the puppet I gave you?<br />
[307060010] A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[307070000] What's that? You want another puppet?<br />
[307070010] Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.<br />
[307070011] Well, aren't you a woman of many passions.<br />
[307070020] But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.<br />
[307070030] I can hardly just give them away.<br />
[307070040] Oh dear, what's to be done?<br />
[307070050] Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?<br />
[307070060] It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue.<br />
[307070070] If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.<br />
[307070080] The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.<br />
[307070090] And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.<br />
[307070100] Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[307080000] You're proving to be quite the puppeteer.<br />
[307080010] I've not had an apprentice for…a very long time indeed.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[307081000] Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?<br />
[307081010] It will produce the finest of puppets.<br />
[307081020] Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.<br />
[307081030] A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[307082000] Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.<br />
[307082001] Heh. I knew I had you pegged.<br />
[307082010] You're just like me.<br />
[307082020] Then I'd like you to procure something.<br />
[307082030] A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.<br />
[307082040] With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.<br />
[307082050] And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...<br />
[307082060] Procure it for me.<br />
[307082070] The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.<br />
[307082080] With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.<br />
[307082090] And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[307083000] Very good.<br />
[307083010] A wise choice, indeed.<br />
[307083020] You passed my little test with flying colours.<br />
[307083030] I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni.<br />
[307083040] Well done, I'm very proud of you.<br />
[307083050] Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[307084000] Ah ha. Might you be interested after all?<br />
[307084010] In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni?  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[307085000] Alright, enough of these games.<br />
[307085010] Your test is well and truly over.<br />
[307085020] Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind.<br />
[307085030] I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[307090000] Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!<br />
[307090010] The blessed day is finally upon us...<br />
[307090020] Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.<br />
[307090030] To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...<br />
[307090040] My oh my oh my...  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[307091000] Ah, are you still here?<br />
[307091010] Oh yes, I should give you your reward.<br />
[307091020] Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous.<br />
[307091030] Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.<br />
[307091040] The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[307092000] Good, I've been waiting for you.<br />
[307092010] It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.<br />
[307092020] Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.<br />
[307092030] The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.<br />
[307092040] Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.<br />
[307092050] Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it.<br />
[307092060] Which is why you're the only one for the job.<br />
[307092070] Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught.  </p>
<h4>Section 93</h4>
<p>[307093000] You...understand, don't you?<br />
[307093010] That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.<br />
[307093020] And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.<br />
[307093030] Just imagine...the pure elation...  </p>
<h4>Section 94</h4>
<p>[307094000] Come now, don't make me wait.<br />
[307094010] I can barely contain myself as it is...  </p>
<h4>Section 95</h4>
<p>[307095000] You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.<br />
[307095010] The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...  </p>
<h3>3071</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307100000] Hmm. Is that a scroll?<br />
[307100010] I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...<br />
[307100020] You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.<br />
[307100030] So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.<br />
[307100040] That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.<br />
[307100050] More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect…<br />
[307100060] …upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[307110000] Oh, perhaps you've already noticed.<br />
[307110010] The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here.<br />
[307110020] If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town,<br />
[307110030] then tell him to pack up and ship out.<br />
[307110040] I never liked the din of a dog's howl.<br />
[307110050] From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[307120000] Well, what have we here?<br />
[307120010] Are you proposing that I partake?<br />
[307120020] Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you?<br />
[307120030] A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss?<br />
[307120040] Well, let me give you some advice.<br />
[307120050] Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against.<br />
[307120060] You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day.  </p>
<h3>3072</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307200000] O-oh!<br />
[307200010] Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship...<br />
[307200011] Y-you! I, er, sorry, madam...<br />
[307200020] I-I apologise for any offence given.<br />
[307200030] I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family.<br />
[307200040] I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307201000] Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use.<br />
[307201001] Ahh, kind madam, allow me to be of use.<br />
[307201010] Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom.<br />
[307201020] Why not pick something out, before you go?<br />
[307201030] But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia...<br />
[307201040] A little something by way of compensation?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[307202000] Ah, a fine day to your worship.<br />
[307202001] Ah, kind madam, a fine day to y-you.<br />
[307202010] Please, choose whatever you like.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[307203000] Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has.<br />
[307203001] Ah, I'm sorry kind madam, but poor Pidia has given all he has.<br />
[307203010] I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[307204000] Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[307205000] Argh!<br />
[307205010] Arrgh!<br />
[307205020] S-stop, please, stop!<br />
[307205030] Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have!<br />
[307205040] How could you forget...such bliss?<br />
[307205050] Ouch!<br />
[307205060] That hurts!<br />
[307205070] Please, I beg you, cease this cruelty!<br />
[307205080] Eeek<br />
[307205090] Eeeeeeek!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[307210000] Oh, that's very kind.<br />
[307210010] Poor Pidia could never accept such a precious brew.<br />
[307210020] Very sorry, really, if I... I've disappointed you,<br />
[307210030] If you will, please forget this matter entirely.  </p>
<h3>3078</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307800000] Agh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307801000] Enough of that, now.<br />
[307801010] Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[307802000] You incorrigible lout.<br />
[307802010] Don't you dare waltz back here ever again.<br />
[307802020] ...  </p>
<h3>3079</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307900000]  <br />
[307900100]    </p>
<h3>Patches [3090]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[309001000] Well, well, well?<br />
[309001010] Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?<br />
[309001020] You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!<br />
[309001030] Cough up your coin, all of it!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[309002000] Wait, wait, please!<br />
[309002010] I surrender! White flag and all!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[309003000] For Pete's sake! I concede!<br />
[309003010] No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know!<br />
[309003020] I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[309004000] Cripes, are you dense, boy?<br />
[309004001] Cripes, are you dense, sweetheart?<br />
[309004010] Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.<br />
[309004020] We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[309005000] Well, finally come around, have you?<br />
[309005010] I knew you would. You're a man of reason, through-and-through.<br />
[309005011] I knew you would. You're a lady of reason, through-and-through.<br />
[309005020] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[309006000] Ahhh...<br />
[309006010] Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me.<br />
[309006020] Now, how did I get that wrong?<br />
[309006030] I took you for a demi-human, or some such.<br />
[309006040] An innocent mistake, I assure you.<br />
[309006050] Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[309007000] A true man of reason. Just what I like about you.<br />
[309007001] A true lady of reason. Just what I like about you.<br />
[309007010] I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.<br />
[309007020] Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.<br />
[309007030] Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.<br />
[309007040] In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.<br />
[309007050] But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.<br />
[309007060] Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.<br />
[309007070] So, don't be a stranger, eh?<br />
[309007080] I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.<br />
[309007090] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[309008000] Slow down, son...<br />
[309008001] Slow down, madame...<br />
[309008010] What's the matter? This simply isn't like you.<br />
[309008020] You've always known an innocent mistake when you see one.<br />
[309008030] Well, suit yourself.<br />
[309008040] I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.<br />
[309008050] Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.<br />
[309008060] Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits are paying for my gruel.<br />
[309008070] In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.<br />
[309008080] But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.<br />
[309008090] I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.<br />
[309008100] So, don't be a stranger, eh?<br />
[309008110] I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.<br />
[309008120] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[309009000] Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.<br />
[309009010] I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.<br />
[309009020] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[309020000] Well, nice of you to drop in, finally.<br />
[309020010] It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something.<br />
[309020020] And welcome to Patches' Emporium.<br />
[309020030] Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[309021000] Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[309022000] Cheers for that.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[309023000] Stingy little beggar...<br />
[309023010] Try to find it in your heart next time, eh?  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[309024000] Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break.<br />
[309024010] Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that.<br />
[309024020] I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying,<br />
[309024030] but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection.<br />
[309024040] They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.<br />
[309024050] Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish.<br />
[309024060] ...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[309025000] Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest?<br />
[309025010] Well, it's uh, nothing too special.<br />
[309025020] Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...<br />
[309025030] But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...<br />
[309025040] And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...<br />
[309025050] Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[309026000] Forgot something on your shopping list?<br />
[309026010] No, no trouble to me.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[309041000] By the way, friend...<br />
[309041010] You've really been there for me, through thick and thin.<br />
[309041020] And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.<br />
[309041030] An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[309042000] What's wrong? I've made up my mind.<br />
[309042010] The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed.<br />
[309042020] Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold.<br />
[309042030] But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[309050000] Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.<br />
[309050010] You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.<br />
[309050020] Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm?<br />
[309050030] But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience.<br />
[309050040] At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.<br />
[309050050] And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[309051000] Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.<br />
[309051010] You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.<br />
[309051020] Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests?<br />
[309051030] No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate.<br />
[309051040] At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.<br />
[309051050] And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[309060000] Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave.<br />
[309060010] I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on.<br />
[309060020] No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop.<br />
[309060030] They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face.<br />
[309060040] Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[309070000] Oh, well! It's been a long while.<br />
[309070010] It's me. Patches the Untethered.<br />
[309070020] I'm still in business, if you can believe it.<br />
[309070030] Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch.<br />
[309070040] Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[309071000] You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell.<br />
[309071010] That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt.<br />
[309071020] In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it...<br />
[309071030] (laughs)  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[309072000] Oh, really? No interest in the statuette?<br />
[309072010] I was sure it would catch your eye.<br />
[309072020] Well, I can't force it on you, but...<br />
[309072030] Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else...  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[309073000] By the way, have you met that girl Rya?<br />
[309073010] I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago.<br />
[309073020] She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help.<br />
[309073030] Not that it's any of my business, but...<br />
[309073040] If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[309074000] Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[309080000] Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine...<br />
[309080010] Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[309081000] You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no?<br />
[309081010] Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.<br />
[309081020] Have you ever seen an iron virgin?<br />
[309081030] The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels.<br />
[309081040] ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.<br />
[309081050] And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[309081060] Its transpositional powers fully intact.<br />
[309081070] So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...<br />
[309081080] It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...<br />
[309081090] Ha ha...ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[309082000] Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.<br />
[309082010] There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[309082020] And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.<br />
[309082030] Heh heh...ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[309090000] Well, fancy meeting you here.<br />
[309090010] Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend.<br />
[309090020] I spoke no lie, not a one.<br />
[309090030] You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,<br />
[309090040] but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.<br />
[309090050] I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.<br />
[309090060] But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?  </p>
<h3>3091</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[309101000] Oh, erm, hello, yes.<br />
[309101010] Strange place for a chance encounter, eh?<br />
[309101020] Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business.<br />
[309101030] Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.<br />
[309101040] Heh heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[309102000] What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot.<br />
[309102010] Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.<br />
[309102020] Heh heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[309110000] Oh, my, well, here you are again.<br />
[309110010] So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went.<br />
[309110020] Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have.<br />
[309110030] But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh.<br />
[309110040] And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!<br />
[309110050] Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.<br />
[309110060] I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.<br />
[309110070] Mm...heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[309111000] You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again.<br />
[309111010] Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.<br />
[309111020] I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.<br />
[309111030] Heh heh...heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[309120000] Well, you've joined the Manor, eh?<br />
[309120010] I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.<br />
[309120020] And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree...<br />
[309120030] All good, though. We're on the same side, now.<br />
[309120040] We'll do good work together.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[309121000] Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like.<br />
[309121010] Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[309130000] Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing.<br />
[309130010] This is for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[309131000] You're new here at the Manor.<br />
[309131010] But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.<br />
[309131020] Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right?<br />
[309131030] Go on, break a leg, then.<br />
[309131040] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[309132000] What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?<br />
[309132010] Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.<br />
[309132020] We're not here to make your life easier.<br />
[309132030] Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.<br />
[309132040] Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[309133040] You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[309134000] You hunted down Tragoth?<br />
[309134010] Are you certain?<br />
[309134020] No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.<br />
[309134030] I'll give Tanith the news.<br />
[309134040] Have some rest, by all means.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[309135000] Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.<br />
[309135010] I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers.<br />
[309135020] I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.<br />
[309135030] Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.<br />
[309135040] I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.<br />
[309135050] Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.<br />
[309135060] I've never seen a woman quite like her...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[309136000] Hmph.<br />
[309136010] Sharper than you seem, aren't you...<br />
[309136020] I was just holding onto it for you, you know.<br />
[309136030] Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[309150000] Now you've gone and killed Rykard?<br />
[309150010] You scheming little bastard.<br />
[309150011] You scheming little doxie.<br />
[309150020] Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...<br />
[309150030] Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...<br />
[309150040] But for now, this Manor is finished.<br />
[309150050] The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.<br />
[309150060] A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.<br />
[309150070] Heh heh...ha ha...<br />
[309150080] Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.<br />
[309150090] Good-bye, my friend.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[309151000] What is it?<br />
[309151010] Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[309160000] Ah, oh, you again...<br />
[309160010] A shame you had to see me like this...<br />
[309160020] Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all.<br />
[309160030] I should have stuck to what I know best...<br />
[309160040] No matter. I know I-I can trust you.<br />
[309160050] Gullible, yes, but a good soul.<br />
[309160060] Make certain that Tanith gets this.<br />
[309160070] Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape.<br />
[309160080] C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[309161000] You're able, then?<br />
[309161010] Then I can rest easy, my friend...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[309170000] Well, well, well?<br />
[309170010] Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?<br />
[309170020] You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!<br />
[309170030] Cough up your coin, all of it!  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[309171000] Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you?<br />
[309171010] Oh, cripes, please, wait!<br />
[309171020] I surrender! I surrender, I swear!  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[309172000] Do you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear!<br />
[309172010] No one likes a bull-headed brute!<br />
[309172020] You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[309173000] Cripes! Are you dense, mate?<br />
[309173010] What in the world has gotten into you!<br />
[309173020] Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.<br />
[309173030] Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[309174000] Well, glad to see we're on the same page.<br />
[309174010] I'd never cross you, not even close.<br />
[309174020] He he he...  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[309175000] Ahhh...<br />
[309175010] It's been ages since I've seen you.<br />
[309175020] I didn't even realise it was you.<br />
[309175030] Took you for a demi-human, or some such.<br />
[309175040] You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.<br />
[309175050] Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[309176000] Hell's bells...<br />
[309176010] This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...<br />
[309176020] Especially if we keep running into the likes of you...<br />
[309176030] ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...  </p>
<h4>Section 77</h4>
<p>[309177000] ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[309190000] Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time.<br />
[309190010] For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium.<br />
[309190020] Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[309191000] Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[309192000] Cheers for that.  </p>
<h4>Section 93</h4>
<p>[309193000] What, do I have to beg?<br />
[309193010] Give us a coin or two next time around, will you?  </p>
<h4>Section 94</h4>
<p>[309194000] Forgot something on your shopping list?<br />
[309194010] No trouble to me.  </p>
<h3>3092</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[309200000] Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it.<br />
[309200010] But, er, I'm alright, thanks.<br />
[309200020] As my dear nan used to say, "there's no such thing as a free lunch"...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[309201000] ...  </p>
<h3>3098</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[309800000] Ngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[309801000] What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[309802000] What's wrong with you?<br />
[309802010] It's me, Patches. Patches!<br />
[309802020] Enough now, stop!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[309803000] Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[309804000] Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming!<br />
[309804010] Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[309806000] Last chance to surrender, mate.<br />
[309806010] Grovel...and I'll forgive you.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[309810000] Well... It was bound to happen some day...<br />
[309810010] What a shit show...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[309820010] Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[309821010] There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[309830000] Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.<br />
[309830010] ...<br />
[309830020] Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?<br />
[309830030] We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.<br />
[309830040] So, what can I do you for today?  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[309840000] Okay, I can see you mean it.<br />
[309840010] Consider it water under the bridge.<br />
[309840020] A momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[309841000] So. Do you need something from me?  </p>
<h3>3099</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[309900000]  <br />
[309900010]  <br />
[309900020]    </p>
<h3>Irina of Morne [3100]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[310001000] Hello? Is somebody there?<br />
[310001010] Might I bend your ear for a moment, please.<br />
[310001020] My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south.<br />
[310001030] The servants there...have rebelled.<br />
[310001040] I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see...<br />
[310001050] But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.<br />
[310001060] My good father secreted me out the castle,<br />
[310001070] but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[310002000] I understand.<br />
[310002010] I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby.<br />
[310002020] Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition.<br />
[310002030] And if you happen to change your mind...<br />
[310002040] Please come to see me again.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[310003000] Hello? Is somebody there?<br />
[310003010] Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you?<br />
[310003020] Please, I implore you.<br />
[310003030] Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?<br />
[310003040] My sole wish is that he escape,
even if his honour should be the price.<br />
[310003050] Please...I just need him to be safe...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[310004000] Thank you, dearly.<br />
[310004010] Then please, take this.<br />
[310004020] ...<br />
[310004030] Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[310005000] Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.<br />
[310005010] He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[310006000] I...I fear for father's life.<br />
[310006010] The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us.<br />
[310006020] They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.
They haven't spared a soul.<br />
[310006030] I fear it's no different at Castle Morne...<br />
[310006040] Please, I implore you.<br />
[310006050] Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?<br />
[310006060] My sole wish is that he escape,
even if his honour should be the price.<br />
[310006070] Please...I just want him to be safe...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[310010000] Hello? Is someone there?<br />
[310010010] My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light.<br />
[310010020] If I might be so bold as to ask...<br />
[310010030] Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?<br />
[310010040] My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see.
I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next.<br />
[310010050] But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light
in the back of my eyes.<br />
[310010070] It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[310011000] Hello? Is someone there?<br />
[310011010] Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?<br />
[310011020] I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light.<br />
[310011030] And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light
in the back of my eyes.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[310012000] Oh, many thanks to you.<br />
[310012010] Now I can feel the distant light once more.<br />
[310012020] You are most kind, indeed.<br />
[310012030] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[310013000] You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...<br />
[310013010] They rest their trembling hands upon me.<br />
[310013020] Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes.<br />
[310013030] Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes.<br />
[310013040] But you...seem somehow...firmer.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[310014000] Oh, many thanks to you.<br />
[310014010] Now I can feel the distant light once more.<br />
[310014020] That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are?<br />
[310014030] Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...<br />
[310014040] What a sight they must be to behold.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[310015000] N-No... That's not possible...<br />
[310015010] Not all of those people... Their own...<br />
[310015020] So those noises I heard were...<br />
[310015030] ...<br />
[310015040] <retching><br />
[310015050] Sorry... I'm alright now.<br />
[310015060] Don't mind me...  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[310016000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[310017000] Ah, is that you over there?<br />
[310017010] I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.<br />
[310017020] The reason why it was eyes I had to eat.<br />
[310017030] The distant light is far and frail.<br />
[310017040] So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye.<br />
[310017050] But with everyone's eyes together, it appears.<br />
[310017060] Finally, it all makes sense.<br />
[310017070] I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[310019000] You are most kind, indeed.<br />
[310019010] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[310020000] You are most kind, indeed.<br />
[310020010] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[310021000] I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes?<br />
[310021010] Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...<br />
[310021020] What a sight they must be to behold.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[310022000] I apologise. You only did as I asked.<br />
[310022010] I'll be fine. Think no more of it.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[310023000] I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.<br />
[310023010] I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[310030000] Oh hello, is that you over there?<br />
[310030010] Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes?<br />
[310030020] They're special grapes which only grow on those
who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...<br />
[310030030] I would truly love to try one...<br />
[310030040] The distant light seems far closer than before,<br />
[310030050] But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore...<br />
[310030060] Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?<br />
[310030070] Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[310031000] Oh, Oh!<br />
[310031010] A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape!<br />
[310031020] Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns...<br />
[310031030] Thank you. I've composed myself again.<br />
[310031040] May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[310032000] Oh, that's right.<br />
[310032010] ...Might I ask a boon of you?<br />
[310032020] Look after this for me, if you please.<br />
[310032030] It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it,
but I've been looking for its owner.<br />
[310032040] Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home.<br />
[310032050] Which is why I'd like you to have it.<br />
[310032060] It must be very, very precious indeed.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[310033000] They're special grapes which only grow on those
who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...<br />
[310033010] Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?<br />
[310033020] Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[310034000] Thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br />
[310034010] I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[310040000] Ah, so you're here as well, are you?<br />
[310040010] ...I realised as we've talked.<br />
[310040020] I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord.<br />
[310040030] Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.<br />
[310040040] It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.<br />
[310040050] May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[310041000] Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.<br />
[310041010] It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[310050000] Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you.<br />
[310050010] Could you please rest your hand upon me?<br />
[310050020] Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[310051000] Oh, it burns...<br />
[310051010] My eyes, my eyes, they're melting...<br />
[310051020] Aaargh!<br />
[310051030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[310052000] Could you please rest your hand upon me?<br />
[310052010] Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[310053000] ...<br />
[310053010] Thank...thank you...<br />
[310053020] I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers.<br />
[310053030] As your maiden, allow me to divine them.<br />
[310053040] All that there is came from the One Great.<br />
[310053050] Then came fractures, and births, and souls.<br />
[310053060] But the Greater Will made a mistake.<br />
[310053070] Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse.<br />
[310053080] Every one, born of the mistake.<br />
[310053090] And so, what was borrowed must be returned.<br />
[310053100] Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame.<br />
[310053110] Until all is One again.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[310054000] Those who gave me grapes howled without words.<br />
[310054010] Saying they wished they were never born.<br />
[310054020] Become their lord.<br />
[310054030] Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse.<br />
[310054040] And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.<br />
[310054050] No more fractures. No more birth...<br />
[310054060] ...  </p>
<h3>3108</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[310800000] Agh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[310801000] What's happened to you?<br />
[310801010] Please, you must stop this.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[310802000] Ah, why on earth?<br />
[310802010] I do not wish to cause anyone harm.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[310803000] Oh, bless the stars.<br />
[310803010] You've chosen to reconsider.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[310804000] Father...<br />
[310804010] Please, be safe...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[310805000] Ahh, the distant light...fades...<br />
[310805010] I'm so sorry, my dears...  </p>

<p>[310900000]  <br />
[310900010]    </p>
<h3>Edgar the Revenger [3110]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[311001000] Ah, there's a face I've not seen before.<br />
[311001010] I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself.<br />
[311001020] But you can see how things have turned out.<br />
[311001030] The menials have all rebelled.<br />
[311001040] They gave me good service, or so I thought,
but it seems it was all an act.<br />
[311001050] Foul creatures, as it's said.
And true enough they're foul inside and out.<br />
[311001060] I'm sorry to disappoint you,<br />
[311001070] But whatever you've come here to do,
I'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer.<br />
[311001080] Take this, by way of apology.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[311002000] Now then, away with you.<br />
[311002010] You've no reason to risk your neck dawdling here, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[311003000] I see, from Irina...<br />
[311003010] Thank you. I'm in your debt.<br />
[311003020] But I can't leave yet.<br />
[311003030] Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain.<br />
[311003040] To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[311004000] If you see Irina, do tell her.<br />
[311004010] That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[311010000] I'm in your debt.<br />
[311010010] For keeping the sword from those fallen creatures.<br />
[311010020] I'm no longer bound by duty.<br />
[311010030] Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[311011000] Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina.<br />
[311011010] And devote my remaining days to her.<br />
[311011020] Irina has a gentle nature, though.<br />
[311011030] I only hope it remains intact.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[311020000] Irina...<br />
[311020010] How could this be…<br />
[311020020] My daughter deserved better…<br />
[311020030] The fault lies...with me.<br />
[311020040] I chose duty over my daughter's safety.<br />
[311020050] And that is how fate has answered…  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[311021000] I'll find them.<br />
[311021010] The foul wretches responsible for this.<br />
[311021020] I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them.<br />
[311021030] Rest assured, Irina. It will be done.  </p>
<h3>3118</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[311800000] Ugh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[311801000] What's this about?<br />
[311801010] We need not fight, I assure you.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[311802000] I haven't a clue what's got into you,<br />
[311802010] but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[311803000] And now even your ilk have complicated matters.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[311804000] Please, enlighten me.<br />
[311804010] What was the purpose of such folly?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[311805010] Please forgive me, Lord Godrick.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[311806000] No, not here, not yet…<br />
[311806010] Forgive me, Iri…na…  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[311810000] Ugh!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[311811000] What's the matter?<br />
[311811010] Cease this at once.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[311812000] Ah, now I see!<br />
[311812010] You had a hand in Irina's undoing!<br />
[311812020] What could she have done to deserve that?  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[311813010] I will not rest until they are eliminated.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[311814000] Forgive me, Irina…<br />
[311814010] I will join you soon enough…  </p>
<h3>3119</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[311900000]  <br />
[311900010]  <br />
[311900020]    </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[311910000]  <br />
[311910010]  <br />
[311910020]    </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[311920010]  <br />
[311920020]  <br />
[311920030]    </p>
<h3>Witch-Hunter Jerren [3120]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[312001000] Oh, Tarnished, are you?<br />
[312001010] How did you slip inside, with the gate closed?<br />
[312001020] Hmph. No matter.<br />
[312001030] If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book.<br />
[312001040] I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness.<br />
[312001050] Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time?<br />
[312001060] Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished.<br />
[312001070] But when the stars align, we celebrate.<br />
[312001080] A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn,<br />
[312001090] the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[312002000] Well, good.<br />
[312002010] As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors.<br />
[312002020] Then all you need is a little patience.<br />
[312002030] When the stars align, the festival will be declared.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[312003000] Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum?<br />
[312003010] No matter. One day you will see.<br />
[312003020] That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[312004000] Have patience, mm.<br />
[312004010] When the stars align, the festival will be declared.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[312005000] Go on, now.<br />
[312005010] This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[312006000] One day you will see, chum.<br />
[312006010] That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[312007000] Go on, now.<br />
[312007010] This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[312020000] Well, I haven't heard that name in an age.<br />
[312020010] Then you must serve Princess Ranni?<br />
[312020020] The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this:<br />
[312020030] The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion.<br />
[312020040] By the by… Is that old fool still hammering out weapons?<br />
[312020050] His enormous frame, cramped in that little place...<br />
[312020060] Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him.<br />
[312020070] And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone.<br />
[312020080] But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[312030000] Champions, welcome!<br />
[312030010] The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh!<br />
[312030020] General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you!<br />
[312030030] Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune!<br />
[312030040] A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[312031000] Are you good and prepared, young chum?<br />
[312031010] The festival begins!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[312034000] But now, we must make merry.<br />
[312034010] O gathering of champions, the revels begin!<br />
[312034020] The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[312035000] You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort.<br />
[312035010] General Radahn is there, even now.<br />
[312035020] Divested of his wits, devouring corpses…<br />
[312035030] And howling at the sky...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[312036000] I see...<br />
[312036010] When you are ready, come to me again.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[312040000] At last, the war festival has ended.<br />
[312040010] Brave champion, you have our gratitude.<br />
[312040020] The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased.<br />
[312040030] Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[312041000] Finally, my work is done.<br />
[312041010] I am no longer bound to this fortress.<br />
[312041020] I have a task in mind.<br />
[312041030] Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand.<br />
[312041040] May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[312042000] It's time I went on my way.<br />
[312042010] May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[312050000] Ah, well met.<br />
[312050010] I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places.<br />
[312050020] You didn't...know Sellen, did you?<br />
[312050030] Well, whatever the case, she's dead now.<br />
[312050040] Just put it behind you.<br />
[312050050] She was known as the Graven Witch.<br />
[312050060] Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand.<br />
[312050070] The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[312051000] Oh, a Tarnished, are you?<br />
[312051010] You didn't...know Sellen, did you?  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[312052000] It is strange, though...<br />
[312052010] The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled.<br />
[312052020] I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.<br />
[312052030] I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.<br />
[312052040] A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[312053000] I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.<br />
[312053010] I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.<br />
[312053020] A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[312060000] My thanks, for the aid given.<br />
[312060010] I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion.<br />
[312060020] But I didn't know he was talking about you.<br />
[312060030] You've helped me fulfil an old promise.<br />
[312060040] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[312061000] My thanks, for the aid given.<br />
[312061010] Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display.<br />
[312061020] You've helped me fulfil an old promise.<br />
[312061030] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[312062000] My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given.<br />
[312062010] You've helped me fulfil an old promise.<br />
[312062020] This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[312063000] Well, I must be leaving now.<br />
[312063010] Brave warrior, if the fates deign it...<br />
[312063020] No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[312064000] Well, I must be leaving now.<br />
[312064010] If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.  </p>
<h3>3128</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[312800000] Ugh!<br />
[312800010] What's the matter with you?<br />
[312800020] You trying to get revenge?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[312801000] Very well.<br />
[312801010] If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...<br />
[312801020] Before you can pose a threat to Caria.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[312802000] Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[312803000] You...are a menace...<br />
[312803010] Iji...beware...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[312804000] Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.<br />
[312804010] I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone.<br />
[312804020] I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[312805000] You must be eliminated...  </p>
<h3>3129</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[312900000]  <br />
[312900010]  <br />
[312900020]    </p>
<h3>Rya the Scout [3130]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[313001000] Hello... Hello...<br />
[313001010] Please... Over here...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[313002000] Hello... Hello...<br />
[313002010] Right over here...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[313003000] Hello.<br />
[313003010] It's rather chilly here, isn't it?<br />
[313003020] My mistress sent me off on an errand...<br />
[313003030] But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind.<br />
[313003040] Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps?<br />
[313003050] That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.<br />
[313003060] I would be sure to provide ample reward.<br />
[313003070] Only... He, too, is Tarnished.<br />
[313003080] If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[313004000] Ohh, thank you dearly.<br />
[313004010] What a blessing that we've met like this.<br />
[313004020] The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...<br />
[313004030] Please, I must have the necklace back.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[313005000] Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do.<br />
[313005010] I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own.<br />
[313005020] But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[313006000] Have you had a change of heart?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[313007000] The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...<br />
[313007010] Please, I must have the necklace back.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[313010000] Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace.<br />
[313010010] Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.<br />
[313010020] Did I forget to announce myself?<br />
[313010030] I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313010040] I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.<br />
[313010050] You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,<br />
[313010060] but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.<br />
[313010070] Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.<br />
[313010080] Please, take this.<br />
[313010090] Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.<br />
[313010100] Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...<br />
[313010110] But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,<br />
[313010120] the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[313011000] Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...<br />
[313011010] This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.<br />
[313011020] But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.<br />
[313011030] Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.<br />
[313011040] At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.<br />
[313011050] It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.<br />
[313011060] I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.<br />
[313011070] I do hope that we can meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[313012000] I've been waiting for you.<br />
[313012010] I knew you had the stuff of champions.<br />
[313012020] I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313012030] Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.<br />
[313012040] I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[313013000] I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[313014000] Very well.<br />
[313014010] Speak to me again once you are ready.<br />
[313014020] You will find me here.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[313015000] Are you ready, then?<br />
[313015010] I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313015020] Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.<br />
[313015030] I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[313016000] Give me your hand.<br />
[313016010] I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[313020000] Hello... Hello...<br />
[313020010] Right over here...<br />
[313020020] But I hardly hold him in high regard.<br />
[313020030] He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313020040] Perhaps it is to be expected, only...<br />
[313020050] his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it.<br />
[313020060] Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[313021000] Brave Tarnished, what is your business here?<br />
[313021010] I'm afraid this is not a guest room.<br />
[313021020] What's that peculiar look upon your face?<br />
[313021030] <gasp><br />
[313021040] Goodness, am I still a serpent?<br />
[313021050] Oh, how dreadful...<br />
[313021060] How dreadful indeed...<br />
[313021070] Forgive my distress.<br />
[313021080] I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.<br />
[313021090] Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313021100] This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.<br />
[313021110] Please forgive the deception.<br />
[313021120] Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing.<br />
[313021130] Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[313022000] Lady Tanith is my mother.<br />
[313022010] I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.<br />
[313022020] That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit.<br />
[313022030] I am proud of what I am.<br />
[313022040] But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me.<br />
[313022050] And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.<br />
[313022060] But you are not like the rest.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[313023000] My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas,<br />
[313023010] were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.<br />
[313023020] Now I share the secrets with you, as well.<br />
[313023030] Please keep them safe from anyone else.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[313024000] Seek the old ruins in the cliff.<br />
[313024010] At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.<br />
[313024020] It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.<br />
[313024030] I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.<br />
[313024040] I do hope that we can meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[313030000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313030010] As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313030020] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[313031000] Have you ever...<br />
[313031010] heard any strange sounds here at the manor?<br />
[313031020] Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...<br />
[313031030] Oh fie, what am I saying?<br />
[313031040] It just isn't possible. I must be tired.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[313032000] Um, oh, it's you.<br />
[313032010] Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late.<br />
[313032020] Hmm, well...<br />
[313032030] I know I can trust you...<br />
[313032040] I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night.<br />
[313032050] It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.<br />
[313032060] If I'm not mistaken,<br />
[313032070] it took the form of a serpent, just like me...<br />
[313032080] Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret,<br />
[313032090] that Lady Tanith has kept from me?<br />
[313032100] I realise that I shouldn't impose but,<br />
[313032110] if you discover anything, would you please share?<br />
[313032120] It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[313033000] The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night...<br />
[313033010] It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.<br />
[313033020] Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets.<br />
[313033030] If you discover anything, would you please share?<br />
[313033040] It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[313034000] Really...<br />
[313034010] Oh, so there was a secret after all...<br />
[313034020] Oh my...<br />
[313034030] Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...<br />
[313034040] Was I not...<br />
[313034050] born by the grace of a king?  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[313035000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313035010] It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand,<br />
[313035020] but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313035030] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[313036000] Hello again. Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313036010] Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia.<br />
[313036020] I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313036030] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[313037000] A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313037010] I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor.<br />
[313037020] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[313038000] Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313038010] Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[313039000] Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls.<br />
[313039010] Like breathing, or slithering scales.<br />
[313039020] Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[313040000] Hmm, what is this?<br />
[313040010] I remember this scent, distinctly.<br />
[313040020] ...<br />
[313040030] Funny, isn't it.<br />
[313040040] I am certain of it. I was born inside this.<br />
[313040050] It's a part of my birth mother.<br />
[313040060] You have my gratitude.<br />
[313040070] Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.<br />
[313040080] I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.<br />
[313040090] One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[313041000] Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...<br />
[313041010] Was I not...<br />
[313041020] born by the grace of a king?  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[313042000] I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.<br />
[313042010] One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[313050000] Oh, it's you...<br />
[313050010] I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.<br />
[313050020] I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.<br />
[313050030] Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents.<br />
[313050040] Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.<br />
[313050050] You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,<br />
[313050060] but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.<br />
[313050070] I know that you have done so much for me.<br />
[313050080] But I wish to ask one last kindness.<br />
[313050090] Kill me, please.<br />
[313050100] I thought that I feared nothing. But this...<br />
[313050110] Free me from this accursed frame.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[313051000] Agh...<br />
[313051010] Thank you... My champion...<br />
[313051020] Mother...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[313052000] I'm to drink this, then?<br />
[313052010] Yes, of course. You always were very kind.<br />
[313052020] ...<br />
[313052030] Ahh... How delightfully sweet...<br />
[313052040] And yet...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[313060000] I know that you have done so much for me.<br />
[313060010] But I wish to ask one last kindness.<br />
[313060020] Kill me, please.<br />
[313060030] I thought that I feared nothing. But this...<br />
[313060040] Free me from this accursed frame.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[313061000] You're not willing to kill me, are you.<br />
[313061010] Hah...<br />
[313061020] You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[313062000] I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts.<br />
[313062010] How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[313070000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[313071000] Oh, it's you.<br />
[313071010] Heaven knows what happened here,<br />
[313071020] but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.<br />
[313071030] It feels rather quiet without them.<br />
[313071040] But with you here, things will be just fine.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[313072000] I await Lady Tanith.<br />
[313072010] I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king.<br />
[313072020] I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.<br />
[313072030] Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour.<br />
[313072040] I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.  </p>
<h3>3138</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[313800000] Please, stop, Brave Tarnished.<br />
[313800010] You will only tire by striking this barrier.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[313801000] Besides, I am no foe of yours.<br />
[313801010] Please, think this over.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[313802000] I see that you have reconsidered.<br />
[313802010] Thank goodness.  </p>
<h3>3139</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[313900000]  <br />
[313900100]    </p>
<h3>Potentate Diallos [3140]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[314001000] Ah, hello. You must be new here.<br />
[314001010] I'm...<br />
[314001020] Well, just call me Diallos.<br />
[314001030] The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.<br />
[314001040] By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?<br />
[314001050] She's my servant, but fickle as the wind.<br />
[314001060] Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.<br />
[314001070] If you find her, please be sure to tell me.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[314002000] Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya.<br />
[314002010] She's a servant to my house.<br />
[314002020] She's been my companion since childhood.<br />
[314002030] I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.<br />
[314002040] Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[314010000] Lanya... Lanya...<br />
[314010010] It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[314011000] Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.<br />
[314011010] The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.
The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.<br />
[314011020] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
and I refuse to let the insult stand.<br />
[314011030] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."<br />
[314011040] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[314012000] Ah, you again, is it?<br />
[314012010] The recusants sent a lackey.<br />
[314012020] Can you believe they invited me to join them?
Now! After what they did...<br />
[314012030] I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?<br />
[314012040] You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.<br />
[314012050] Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.<br />
[314012060] It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west
from the town of windmills.<br />
[314012070] That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.<br />
[314012080] Just you wait, wretched recusants.<br />
[314012090] You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya.<br />
[314012100] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[314013000] Who on earth are you?<br />
[314013010] Hmph, never mind. But tell me if you know, would you.<br />
[314013020] The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends.
The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.<br />
[314013030] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
and I refuse to let the insult stand.<br />
[314013040] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."<br />
[314013050] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[314014000] They laid hands upon my servant Lanya,
and I refuse to let the insult stand.<br />
[314014010] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."<br />
[314014020] I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[314015000] It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west
from the town of windmills.<br />
[314015010] That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.<br />
[314015020] Just you wait, wretched recusants.<br />
[314015030] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[314020000] Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it?<br />
[314020010] Well. Nice to see you again.<br />
[314020020] So you've been invited as well, I see.<br />
[314020030] Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth.
You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[314021000] I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya...<br />
[314021010] Well, you see, I...<br />
[314021020] After much internal debate, I've come to realise...<br />
[314021030] Revenge is not the answer.<br />
[314021040] According to Lady Tanith...<br />
[314021050] I've got the stuff of champions.<br />
[314021060] And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.<br />
[314021070] It hit me like a bolt from the blue...<br />
[314021080] That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.<br />
[314021090] Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.<br />
[314021100] That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.<br />
[314021110] But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't
make me a champion, will it.<br />
[314021120] Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.<br />
[314021130] But such is true of any road trod by champions.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[314022000] I always resented these hands.<br />
[314022010] Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.<br />
[314022020] But that won't be the case for long.<br />
[314022030] They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.<br />
[314022040] "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[314030000] Ah, it's you, is it.<br />
[314030010] I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself?<br />
[314030020] I haven't achieved anything at all thus far.<br />
[314030030] Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.<br />
[314030040] I'm still yet to achieve anything.<br />
[314030050] Perhaps I am a fool after all...<br />
[314030060] No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the
path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.<br />
[314030070] What an easy mark I must have been...<br />
[314030080] How did it take me so long to realise, honestly...<br />
[314030090] There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[314031000] It's just as my noble brother says.<br />
[314031010] I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become
a champion.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[314032000] Perhaps I am a fool after all...<br />
[314032010] No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the
path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.<br />
[314032020] What an easy mark I must have been...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[314040000] Well. Aren't you full of beans.<br />
[314040010] No wonder you're covered in muck.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[314041000] Oh? My friend, it's been far too long.<br />
[314041010] I have to say you caught me at a rather low point.<br />
[314041020] But...as you see, I've put all that behind me.<br />
[314041030] Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now.
Making my own choices.<br />
[314041040] Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars.<br />
[314041050] Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time
in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[314042000] A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars.<br />
[314042010] Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time
in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[314051000] ...Ah, you...<br />
[314051010] Are the jars...they alright?<br />
[314051020] Did I defend them?  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[314052000] Then all is well...<br />
[314052010] This fool proved his worth, in the end...  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[314053000] Ha...ha ha...<br />
[314053010] I see... I see...<br />
[314053020] I've been a fool...to the last...  </p>
<h3>3148</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[314800000] Agh!<br />
[314800010] What on earth was that for!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[314801000] Now I see. You're a wretched recusant!<br />
[314801010] May you rue the day that you thought to trample me!<br />
[314801020] The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!<br />
[314801030] In blood!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[314802000] Lanya, your honour has been restored.<br />
[314802010] As a charge of House Hoslow, you can rest easy.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[314803000] Ha ha...ha...<br />
[314803010] I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[314810000] Ugh!<br />
[314810010] What's the matter? Please, stop!<br />
[314810020] I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor.<br />
[314810030] I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[314811000] Why on earth...?<br />
[314811010] Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you?<br />
[314811020] I'll turn my back on duty no more.<br />
[314811030] The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!<br />
[314811040] In blood!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[314812000] Unharmed, thank the stars.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[314813000] Ahh, just what I deserve...<br />
[314813010] For absconding from my duties...<br />
[314813020] I'm sorry, my dear jars...  </p>
<h3>3149</h3>

[314910020]    </p>
<h3>Sorceress Sellen [3160]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[316001000] Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.<br />
[316001010] I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly.<br />
[316001020] Why are you here?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[316002000] Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?<br />
[316002010] Well, your aptitude does appear...passable.<br />
[316002020] But one must choose one's masters wisely.<br />
[316002030] I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria,<br />
[316002040] as a reviled, apostate witch.<br />
[316002050] Do you still wish to learn from me?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[316003000] Well, you are a piece of work.<br />
[316003010] Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery.<br />
[316003020] But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.<br />
[316003030] Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[316004000] Really.<br />
[316004010] It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[316005000] What is it now? Why are you here again?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[316006000] ...<br />
[316006010] You are quite the enigma, aren't you...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[316007000] I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal...<br />
[316007010] Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[316008000] Yes, I think that would be wise.<br />
[316008010] We must choose our masters wisely.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[316009000] Well? Have you made up your mind?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[316010000] Young apprentice. First things first.<br />
[316010010] You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.<br />
[316010020] So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance.<br />
[316010030] Now, shall we start learning?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[316011000] There you are, my apprentice.<br />
[316011010] Shall we commence the lesson?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[316012000] You wish to continue the lesson?<br />
[316012010] Very well, I have time aplenty.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[316020000] Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone.<br />
[316020010] But what is the nature of such power?<br />
[316020020] Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos.<br />
[316020030] Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality,<br />
[316020040] while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars.<br />
[316020050] It should not be forgotten,<br />
[316020060] that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.<br />
[316020070] A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[316021000] Your appetite for learning is impressive.<br />
[316021010] You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.<br />
[316021020] You must have a fabulous teacher.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[316030000] Hmm? What's on your mind?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[316031000] Well, well...<br />
[316031010] Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again...<br />
[316031020] But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge.<br />
[316031030] The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.<br />
[316031040] But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.<br />
[316031050] Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.<br />
[316031060] If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.<br />
[316031070] And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[316040000] My apprentice, what happened to your nail?<br />
[316040010] Perhaps you have a different view, but...<br />
[316040020] That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.<br />
[316040030] May I remove it for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[316041000] A wise choice. Let me neutralize it.<br />
[316041010] But first...<br />
[316041020] Listen up, wretched curse-peddler.<br />
[316041030] This is a vile craft in which you engage.<br />
[316041040] Let it be known.<br />
[316041050] This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch.<br />
[316041060] I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand.<br />
[316041070] Your death will not be a pleasant one.<br />
[316041080] May you shudder between breaths in your sleep...  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[316042000] If you prefer not, that is your prerogative.<br />
[316042010] But let it be known.<br />
[316042020] That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.<br />
[316042030] If what I have told you one day rings true,<br />
[316042040] by all means, come to me again.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[316050000] What's this sorcery, my apprentice?<br />
[316050010] Ah, then you have seen Master Azur.<br />
[316050020] Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher.<br />
[316050030] A stern judge of men, but he must see something in you.<br />
[316050040] You make us both proud.<br />
[316050050] We can speak more later, my apprentice.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[316060000] If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[316060010] It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.<br />
[316060020] The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care.<br />
[316060030] I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos.<br />
[316060040] No matter what we give in return.<br />
[316060050] My apprentice. I presume nothing.<br />
[316060060] Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path.<br />
[316060070] But hear me out, my apprentice.<br />
[316060080] I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.<br />
[316060090] Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[316061000] Splendid. I thank you.<br />
[316061010] This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.<br />
[316061020] You must have a fabulous teacher.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[316062000] Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with.<br />
[316062010] And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well.<br />
[316062020] Don't give it another thought, my apprentice.  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[316063000] Really? My apprentice.<br />
[316063010] You must have given this quite some thought.<br />
[316063020] Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me.<br />
[316063030] It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[316064000] There you are, my apprentice.<br />
[316064010] Shall we commence the lesson?  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[316065000] You wish to resume the lesson?<br />
[316065010] Indeed, that would be the wiser option.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[316070000] I need your help, my apprentice.<br />
[316070010] Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer.<br />
[316070020] And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere.<br />
[316070030] My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat?<br />
[316070040] With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[316071000] I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.<br />
[316071010] He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[316072000] After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home.<br />
[316072010] A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds.<br />
[316072020] Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer.<br />
[316072030] It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[316080000] Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...<br />
[316080010] You have my gratitude. This is all your work.<br />
[316080020] I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit.<br />
[316080030] This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.<br />
[316080040] This brings us a full step closer.<br />
[316080050] The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the Academy.<br />
[316080060] If only I could undo these wretched shackles...  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[316081000] This brings us a full step closer.<br />
[316081010] The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy.<br />
[316081020] If only I could undo these wretched shackles...  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[316090000] My apprentice. Give me a moment later.<br />
[316090010] I have a favour to ask.<br />
[316090020] The form you see before you is merely a projection.<br />
[316090030] My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved.<br />
[316090040] My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,<br />
[316090050] imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.<br />
[316090060] Can you make the journey to my body?<br />
[316090070] I have something that I can only trust with you.  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[316092000] My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,<br />
[316092010] imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.<br />
[316092020] Can you make the journey to my body?<br />
[316092030] I have something that I can only trust with you.  </p>
<h3>3161</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[316100000] My apprentice, thank you for coming.<br />
[316100010] These shackles take a toll on us all.<br />
[316100020] There is something I need you to look after.<br />
[316100030] My primal glintstone.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[316101000] A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver.<br />
[316101010] Someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you.<br />
[316101020] My self.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[316102000] <groaning in pain><br />
[316102010]    </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[316103000] <panting><br />
[316103010]  <br />
[316103020] Thank you...my apprentice...<br />
[316103030] This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[316104000] <shivering moans><br />
[316104010]  <br />
[316104020]  <br />
[316104030] It will do no good, I swear it...<br />
[316104040] ...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...<br />
[316104050] A...argh!<br />
[316104060] <shivering moans>  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[316105000] Treat it with care, my apprentice...<br />
[316105010] What you hold is my very being...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[316110000] My apprentice, just how long has it been?<br />
[316110010] Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again.<br />
[316110020] And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone.<br />
[316110030] Better still, I've shed those awful shackles.<br />
[316110040] Finally, I can return to the academy.<br />
[316110050] To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.<br />
[316110060] My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[316111000] Finally, I can return to the academy.<br />
[316111010] To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[316112000] My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson?<br />
[316112010] As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[316113000] You wish to resume the lesson?<br />
[316113010] Have I not been strict enough, I wonder?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[316120000] Ahh, my apprentice.<br />
[316120010] You've saved my skin once again.<br />
[316120020] Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.<br />
[316120030] With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.<br />
[316120040] So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.<br />
[316120050] My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?<br />
[316120060] Oh, I know it's not possible.<br />
[316120070] You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.<br />
[316120080] But do think of me.<br />
[316120090] Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.<br />
[316120100] You will always be my darling pupil.<br />
[316120110] Rest assured that I...<br />
[316120120] No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.<br />
[316120130] My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[316121000] Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead,<br />
[316121010] but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[316122000] Do you recall what once I told you?<br />
[316122010] That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.<br />
[316122020] When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.<br />
[316122030] Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.<br />
[316122040] Next time, I will be your student.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[316123000] Oh, one last thing.<br />
[316123010] If you fail to claim your throne,<br />
[316123020] you can always pay me a visit.<br />
[316123030] Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.<br />
[316123040]    </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[316125000] What is it? My apprentice.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[316126000] Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice.<br />
[316126010] Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[316127000] It warms my heart. That you still think of me.<br />
[316127010] Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat.<br />
[316127020] His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current...  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[316128000] Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...<br />
[316128010] Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home.<br />
[316128020] And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current.<br />
[316128030] So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again.<br />
[316128040] I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this.<br />
[316128050] What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit.<br />
[316128060] This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[316129000] You wish to resume the lesson?<br />
[316129010] Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not?<br />
[316129030] With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current.<br />
[316129040] So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[316130000] Jerren, bringer of my death.<br />
[316130010] You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.<br />
[316130020] But I am afraid your work is done.<br />
[316130030] Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[316140000] U...urgh<br />
[316140010] M-my...apprentice...<br />
[316140020] I-I'm...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[316141000] My...apprentice...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[316150000] Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days.<br />
[316150010] Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar.<br />
[316150020] I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons.<br />
[316150030] Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.  </p>
<h3>3168</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[316800000] What's the meaning of this?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[316801000] How unfortunate.<br />
[316801010] That we should part ways in this manner...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[316802000] Ngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[316803000] Why, you. Are you mad?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[316804000] My death would only be temporary.<br />
[316804010] Your savagery achieves nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[316805000] Agh!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[316806000] Why, you. Are you mad?<br />
[316806010] Another moment of this, and no amount of grovelling will spare you.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[316807000] You sadden me, my apprentice.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[316808000] Ahh, how can this be...<br />
[316808010] ...every fallen child... must shine again...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[316809000] For a time, I believed us kindred spirits.<br />
[316809010] My apprentice...  </p>
<h3>3169</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[316900000]  <br />
[316900010]  <br />
[316900020]    </p>
<h3>Shabriri [3180]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[318001000] If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger.<br />
[318001010] The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[318010000] Just joining the fray, Tarnished?<br />
[318010010] Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.<br />
[318010020] I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.<br />
[318010030] Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.<br />
[318010040] If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.<br />
[318010050] Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.<br />
[318010060] Don't let your emotions stay your blade.<br />
[318010900] Well, you fought Nerijus and made good your escape. Fortune favours you, it seems.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[318011000] Oh, one other thing...<br />
[318011010] There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers.<br />
[318011020] If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring.<br />
[318011030] If fortune takes your side, a hunter will come to your aid.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[318013000] Just joining the fray, Tarnished?<br />
[318013010] I am Yura, hunter of Bloody Fingers.<br />
[318013020] Have you ever faced a Bloody Finger?<br />
[318013030] They are Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.<br />
[318013040] If you stay the path, you will face this blight, sooner or later.<br />
[318013050] Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.<br />
[318013060] Don't let your emotions stay your blade.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[318014000] If fortune remains on your side, a hunter will come to your aid.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[318015000] One last word of warning.<br />
[318015010] Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[318016000] Be on your way.<br />
[318016010] Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[318020000] Well, we meet again.<br />
[318020010] Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake.<br />
[318020020] And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.<br />
[318020030] So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...<br />
[318020040] stay clear of the lake.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[318021000] Hmm, I gave you fair warning.<br />
[318021010] To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost.<br />
[318021020] Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[318022000] Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[318023000] Ah, we meet again.<br />
[318023010] To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle.<br />
[318023020] To have fought Nerijus and escaped, fortune must smile upon you indeed.<br />
[318023030] I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.<br />
[318023040] Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.<br />
[318023050] If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.<br />
[318023060] Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.<br />
[318023070] Don't let your emotions stay your blade.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[318024000] Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.<br />
[318024010] You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling. A dragon roosts there...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[318025000] You bloody halfwit.<br />
[318025010] Picking a fight with a dragon?<br />
[318025020] Well, I can tell you want to see it through.<br />
[318025030] Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[318026000] Ah, we meet again.<br />
[318026010] I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.<br />
[318026020] Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.<br />
[318026030] If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.<br />
[318026040] Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.<br />
[318026050] Don't let your emotions stay your blade.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[318027000] Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.<br />
[318027010] And quite the fool, by the look of it.<br />
[318027020] Picking a fight with a dragon? Hah.<br />
[318027030] Well, I can tell you want to see it through.<br />
[318027040] Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[318028000] I can tell you want to see it through.<br />
[318028010] Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[318030000] There you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time.<br />
[318030010] Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.<br />
[318030040] Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.<br />
[318030050] That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.<br />
[318030060] If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,<br />
[318030070] then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[318031000] You must not forget, though.<br />
[318031010] Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity.<br />
[318031020] Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens.<br />
[318031030] Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment.<br />
[318031040] The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly.<br />
[318031050] It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[318032000] Beautiful work, felling that dragon.<br />
[318032010] And as such, there's something you might like to know.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[318033000] ...<br />
[318033010] Wretched worms, leave me be...<br />
[318033020]    </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[318034000] Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.<br />
[318034010] That was my first dragon hunt in quite a while.<br />
[318034020] Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.<br />
[318034030] Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.<br />
[318034040] The heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.<br />
[318034050] If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,<br />
[318034060] then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[318035000] Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.<br />
[318035010] Beautiful work, felling that dragon.<br />
[318035020] And as such, there's something you might like to know.<br />
[318035030] That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.<br />
[318035040] If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,<br />
[318035050] then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[318040000] Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.<br />
[318040010] That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.<br />
[318040020] Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[318041000] I may not have much time.<br />
[318041010] I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[318042000] Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.<br />
[318042010] She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.<br />
[318042020] But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.<br />
[318042030] If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.<br />
[318042040] There is no shame in self-preservation.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[318043000] Be on your way.<br />
[318043010] Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[318070000] Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you.<br />
[318070010] But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.<br />
[318070020] I've sliced the finger off.<br />
[318070030] Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.<br />
[318070040] Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[318080000] Finally, we meet.<br />
[318080010] The Tarnished, who would be Lord.<br />
[318080020] Oh my, why the long face?<br />
[318080030] I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.<br />
[318080040] Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead.<br />
[318080050] As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri.<br />
[318080060] I hope you can make your peace with that.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[318081000] You are about to sacrifice something precious.<br />
[318081010] The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge.<br />
[318081020] Only so that you may be Lord.<br />
[318081030] What a horrible thing to ponder.<br />
[318081040] Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.<br />
[318081050] But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[318082000] Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor.<br />
[318082010] Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead.<br />
[318082020] If you are prepared to show resolve,<br />
[318082030] and attain Lordship through righteous hardship,<br />
[318082040] then heed the words of I, Shabriri.  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[318083000] Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.<br />
[318083010] Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.<br />
[318083020] Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.<br />
[318083030] If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling,<br />
[318083040] and the girl can be spared.<br />
[318083050] ...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.<br />
[318083060] The path of the Lord of Chaos.<br />
[318083070] Burn the Erdtree to the ground,<br />
[318083080] and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.<br />
[318083090] Ahh, may chaos take the world!<br />
[318083100] May chaos take the world!  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[318084000] Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.<br />
[318084010] Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.<br />
[318084020] Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[318085000] Burn the Erdtree to the ground,<br />
[318085010] and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.<br />
[318085020] Ahh, may chaos take the world!<br />
[318085030] May chaos take the world!  </p>
<h3>3188</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[318800000] Ugh.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[318801000] That will be quite enough.<br />
[318801010] What do you stand to gain by challenging me?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[318802000] Too late for you, eh?<br />
[318802010] Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood...<br />
[318802020] it's better that I finish you here.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[318803000] I had no choice.<br />
[318803010] Your death could have been much worse.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[318804000] What a wretched fate.<br />
[318804010] Why did you turn foul...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[318805000] I must not die...<br />
[318805010] until she is eradicated...<br />
[318805020]    </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[318820000] What's this?  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[318821000] Well, this is peculiar.<br />
[318821010] Is this how you express contempt?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[318822000] This, I did not expect.<br />
[318822010] But if you do not care for Lordship,<br />
[318822020] I'm afraid you are of no use.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[318823000] How very unfortunate.<br />
[318823010] I did not take you for a fraud.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[318824000] Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die.<br />
[318824010] Until we meet again, in another place or time.<br />
[318824020] Ahh, may chaos take the world!  </p>
<h3>3189</h3>

<h3>D, Hunter of the Dead [3190]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[319001000] There's no mistake, is there?<br />
[319001010] Death has left its mark once again.<br />
[319001020] I'm sorry, I cannot give you your proper rites...<br />
[319001030] But at least you did not join Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[319001040] Your soul will return to the Erdtree, in time.<br />
[319001050] Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[319002000] Ah, a Tarnished, are you?<br />
[319002010] I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.<br />
[319002020] Heed my warning.<br />
[319002030] The village here has been touched by Death.<br />
[319002040] And worse yet, it is home to a mariner.<br />
[319002050] If you value your life, then go no further.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[319003000] The village here has been touched by Death.<br />
[319003010] Turn back, while you still can.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[319010000] Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?<br />
[319010010] But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.<br />
[319010020] ...<br />
[319010030] How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?<br />
[319010040] If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,<br />
[319010050] then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.<br />
[319010060] I have a matter of my own to attend to.<br />
[319010070] And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.<br />
[319010080] What say you?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[319011000] Very well. Show me your map.<br />
[319011010] ...<br />
[319011020] I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.<br />
[319011030] It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[319012000] I have a matter of my own to attend to.<br />
[319012010] I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village.<br />
[319012020] An ill-omened symbol that should not be.<br />
[319012030] Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.<br />
[319012040] And must be eradicated.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[319013000] What is it? Still milling about?<br />
[319013010] The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.<br />
[319013020] It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[319014000] Well, all right, then.<br />
[319014010] No sense in forcing you.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[319015000] What now? Had a change of heart?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[319016000] Ah, a Tarnished, are you?<br />
[319016010] With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.<br />
[319016020] ...<br />
[319016030] I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.<br />
[319016040] How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?<br />
[319016050] If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,<br />
[319016060] then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.<br />
[319016070] I have a matter of my own to attend to.<br />
[319016080] And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[319020000] Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look!<br />
[319020010] See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood!<br />
[319020020] This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone!<br />
[319020030] This is a proper death, O Prince!<br />
[319020040] Look at this rotten whore. No more children can be got from this useless flesh!<br />
[319020050] Behold, your mother is dead!<br />
[319020060] Heh heh heh heh...<br />
[319020070] This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[319021000] Ah. Hello.<br />
[319021010] The rotten witch is dead. The Golden Order, unsullied.<br />
[319021020] Now I can look my brother Darian in the eye.<br />
[319021030] Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[319022000] Darian, now I have no regrets.<br />
[319022010] Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[319030000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[319031000] Ah, aah...<br />
[319031010] D-da...ri...<br />
[319031020] Ngh...nnngh...<br />
[319031030]    </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[319032000] Ah, mm...<br />
[319032010] Y-You...<br />
[319032020] I require the sword...and raiment...of D...<br />
[319032030] I require the sword...of D...<br />
[319032040] For revenge...<br />
[319032050] For the wrath...of D...  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[319033000] Yeeesss...<br />
[319033010] YESSS!<br />
[319033020] Soon you will know, filthy witch...<br />
[319033030] Soon you will know... Vengeance for Darian.<br />
[319033040] The wrath of D...  </p>
<h3>D, Hunter of the Dead [3191]</h3>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[319120000] I don't believe we've met.<br />
[319120010] I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.<br />
[319120020] Heed my warning.<br />
[319120030] Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.<br />
[319120040] All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.<br />
[319120050] Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[319121000] Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.<br />
[319121010] All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[319122000] Ah...we meet again.<br />
[319122010] I'm glad you took my warning to heart.<br />
[319122020] Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.<br />
[319122030] All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[319130000] Well, well...<br />
[319130010] Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?<br />
[319130020] But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.<br />
[319130030] With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.<br />
[319130040] ...<br />
[319130050] How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?<br />
[319130060] If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,<br />
[319130070] then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.<br />
[319130080] I have a matter of my own to attend to.<br />
[319130090] And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.<br />
[319130100] What say you?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[319131000] Very well. Show me your map.<br />
[319131010] ...<br />
[319131020] I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.<br />

[319132030] Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.<br />
[319132040] And must be eradicated.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[319133000] What is it? Still milling about?<br />
[319133010] The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.<br />
[319133020] It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[319134000] Well, all right, then.<br />
[319134010] No sense in forcing you.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[319135000] What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you?  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[319140000] You've met Gurranq, I take it?<br />
[319140010] Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms.<br />
[319140020] I think you've earned this.<br />
[319140030] The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[319141000] Did you need something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[319142000] Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[319143000] Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it.<br />
[319143010] I thank you, as your brother-in-arms.<br />
[319143020] So what can I do for you?  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[319144000] Ah, hello again.<br />
[319144010] You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you?<br />
[319144020] Well, no rush. You do as you please.<br />
[319144030] Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[319145000] Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right.<br />
[319145010] Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot...<br />
[319145020] Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[319150000] I serve the Golden Order.<br />
[319150010] That I might put this crooked land to rights.<br />
[319150020] Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring.<br />
[319150030] Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.<br />
[319150040] Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth.<br />
[319150050] And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[319151000] Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier?<br />
[319151010] You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony?<br />
[319151020] He was a formidable spellblade, in times past.<br />
[319151030] Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind.<br />
[319151040] No more though.<br />
[319151050] You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling...<br />
[319151060] Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch.<br />
[319151070] Take well the lesson, friend.<br />
[319151080] That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[319151090] When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[319152000] Well, what have we here?<br />
[319152010] How did you get your hands on that dagger?<br />
[319152020] ...<br />
[319152030] Well. That hardly matters.<br />
[319152040] I know very well whose dagger it is.<br />
[319152050] Why don't I return it to them for you?<br />
[319152060] Good work, bringing this to me.  </p>
<h3>3198</h3>

<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[319801000] Very well.<br />
[319801010] Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[319802000] I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[319803000] How could this...happen...?<br />
[319803010] Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[319810000] Oof!<br />
[319810010] What's the meaning of this?<br />
[319810020] Has she bewitched you?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[319811000] Very well.<br />
[319811010] Then you are a blight.<br />
[319811020] A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother!<br />
[319811030] Die! Die! Die!<br />
[319811040] I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains.<br />
[319811050] A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[319812000] You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[319813000] How could this...<br />
[319813010] Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian...  </p>

<h3>Roderika, Spirit Tuner [3200]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[320001000] Everyone's...been grafted.<br />
[320001010] Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.<br />
[320001020] Heh...<br />
[320001030] Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken.
Taken and stuck to the spider.<br />
[320001040] Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.<br />
[320001050] It's quite the lark, when you think about it.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[320002000] You're all on your own, are you?<br />
[320002010] And heading to Stormveil Castle?<br />
[320002020] Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?<br />
[320002030] Well, that makes us two peas in a pod.<br />
[320002040] But I don't have your courage.<br />
[320002050] It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.<br />
[320002060] I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.<br />
[320002070] I'm nothing but a craven.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[320003000] Oh, I know.<br />
[320003010] Can you take this little one along with you?<br />
[320003020] Can you take these little ones along with you?<br />
[320003030] The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself…<br />
[320003040] And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.<br />
[320003050] It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.<br />
[320003060] They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.<br />
[320003900] The poor things deserve someone braver than myself…  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[320005000] It was a pleasure to see you.<br />
[320005010] Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?<br />
[320005020] Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.<br />
[320005030] I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know.<br />
[320005040] Heh heh...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[320013000] What's this?<br />
[320013010] A keepsake? From my men?<br />
[320013020] Oh, goodness me…<br />
[320013030] I can't…<br />
[320013040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[320014000] A pleasure to see you.<br />
[320014010] Did you give the little chrysalids the message?<br />
[320014020] That I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[320020000] They all...believed in me.<br />
[320020010] They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...<br />
[320020020] I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[320020030] Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[320021000] I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[320021010] Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[320030000] Greetings. Nice to see you again.<br />
[320030010] My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner.<br />
[320030020] Isn't this place impressive, though?<br />
[320030030] The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.<br />
[320030040] I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.<br />
[320030050] Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.<br />
[320030060] I'm still looking for my own purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[320032000] You're telling me I possess some kind of gift?<br />
[320032010] I don't believe you. But...<br />
[320032020] If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...<br />
[320032030] I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?<br />
[320032040] I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.<br />
[320032050] Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...<br />
[320032060] But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...<br />
[320032070] I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[320033000] Oh, and…<br />
[320033010] Please, allow to me to express my thanks.<br />
[320033020] For giving me that keepsake from my men.<br />
[320033030] It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn.<br />
[320033040] You have my gratitude. Please, take this.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[320034000] A pleasure to meet you.<br />
[320034010] My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival.<br />
[320034020] Isn't this place impressive?<br />
[320034030] The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.<br />
[320034040] I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.<br />
[320034050] Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.<br />
[320034060] I'm still looking for my own purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[320035000] It's all a bit much for me, in truth.<br />
[320035010] I'm still looking for my own purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[320036000] A pleasure to see you.<br />
[320036010] Thank goodness you're safe.<br />
[320036020] I'm still looking for my own purpose.<br />
[320036030] It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[320037000] If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise…<br />
[320037010] I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?<br />
[320037020] I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[320040000] Good to see you again. Thank you very much!<br />
[320040010] I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?<br />
[320040020] I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.<br />
[320040030] I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish,<br />
[320040040] but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.<br />
[320040050] And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted...<br />
[320040060] Well, I certainly must try.<br />
[320040070] Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[320050000] Greetings.<br />
[320050010] Are you here for spirit tuning?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[320051000] I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.<br />
[320051010] I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order.<br />
[320051020] I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...<br />
[320051030] Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer.<br />
[320051040]  <br />
[320051050] Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[320052000] I'd like to ask you a small favour.<br />
[320052010] Can you take this little one along with you?<br />
[320052020] Can you take these little ones along with you?<br />
[320052030] They can't be summoned here.<br />
[320052040] But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.<br />
[320052050] It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.<br />
[320052060] They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[320053000] I need to warn you about something.<br />
[320053010] A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.<br />
[320053020] And I can hear, from all the way over there...<br />
[320053030] The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...<br />
[320053040] A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...<br />
[320053050] I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...<br />
[320053060] Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...<br />
[320053070] You should keep your distance.<br />
[320053080] I know you're strong, but please...  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[320054000] I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...<br />
[320054010] The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...<br />
[320054020] You should keep your distance.<br />
[320054030] I know you're strong, but please...  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[320055000] I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse...<br />
[320055010] I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.<br />
[320055020] I just pray nothing ill comes of this.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[320056000] Be on your guard, I beg you.<br />
[320056010] He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.<br />
[320056020] I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.<br />
[320056030] And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.<br />
[320056040] But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.<br />
[320056050] I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[320057000] The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again..<br />
[320057010] But it isn't like last time.<br />
[320057020] I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.<br />
[320057030] Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[320060000] Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.<br />
[320060010] The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left.<br />
[320060020] Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain.<br />
[320060030] Don't worry, I don't blame you.<br />
[320060040] I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before.<br />
[320060050] Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.<br />
[320060060] His roots are so knotted in this place.<br />
[320060070] He won't last much longer if he stays here...<br />
[320060080] His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now.<br />
[320060090] It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[320061000] I see. You're here for some spirit tuning?  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[320070000] Oh, is that right...<br />
[320070010] So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.<br />
[320070020] You have my thanks, regardless.<br />
[320070030] I'll try and talk him round next time.<br />
[320070040] I know he was given this great entreaty;<br />
[320070050] To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse.<br />
[320070060] A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.<br />
[320070070] And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[320080000] Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to...<br />
[320080010] To think he'd forget who you were, as well.<br />
[320080020] I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.<br />
[320080030] I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.<br />
[320080040] But maybe it's better that we don't.<br />
[320080050] It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[320081000] I'll remain with Hewg.<br />
[320081010] He made me who I am today.<br />
[320081020] I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[320082000] Please, become Elden Lord.<br />
[320082010] Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.<br />
[320082020] So slay her, with the weapons he smithed.<br />
[320082030] Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[320090000] You're...giving it to me?<br />
[320090010] I've never had alcohol before...<br />
[320090020] I'm no longer a child. It's about time I took this step.  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[320091000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h3>3208</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[320800000] You're willing to make me a chrysalid?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[320801000] Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven...<br />
[320801010] I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[320802000] Please. You're only wasting your strength.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[320803000] I know how you must feel.<br />
[320803010] But please, I'm not ready.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[320804000] Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear...<br />
[320804010] You've divested yourself of all reason?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[320805000] Please, stop.<br />
[320805010] Even if you persist, your fear will not abate.  </p>
<h3>Kenneth Haight, Limgrave Heir [3210]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[321001000] Hello? Is anybody there?<br />
[321001010] Someone who might be interested in rescuing the great Kenneth Haight?<br />
[321001020] Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false!<br />
[321001030] O Erdtree! Grant me succour!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[321003000] What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?<br />
[321003010] My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.<br />
[321003020] Oh I see. You wish to know the reward?<br />
[321003030] Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse.<br />
[321003040] The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[321004000] Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice.<br />
[321004010] I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes.<br />
[321004020] That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting".<br />
[321004030] Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.<br />
[321004040] First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle...<br />
[321004050] Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.<br />
[321004060] Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse?<br />
[321004070] And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him.<br />
[321004080] I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[321005000] What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?<br />
[321005010] My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[321010000] Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you?<br />
[321010010] Well, that's very kind, but, um...<br />
[321010020] No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.<br />
[321010030] Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.<br />
[321010040] You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.<br />
[321010050] Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.<br />
[321010060] I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.<br />
[321010070] A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[321014000] Hm? What's this, kind sir?<br />
[321014001] Hm? What's this, fair lady?<br />
[321014010] Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already!<br />
[321014020] A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one.<br />
[321014030] Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed.<br />
[321014040] I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you.<br />
[321014050] Now, this is your reward.<br />
[321014060] Go on, it is yours, for the keeping.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[321020000] Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath!<br />
[321020010] Did you manage to recapture my fort?<br />
[321020020] Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot!<br />
[321020030] Well done my friend, well done indeed!<br />
[321020040] I knew I was right to trust you!<br />
[321020050] Now, here's your reward, as promised.<br />
[321020060] Go ahead, it's all yours.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[321021000] Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.<br />
[321021010] I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.<br />
[321021020] What's that look? You don't believe me?<br />
[321021030] Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible.<br />
[321021040] Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order.<br />
[321021050] Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it.<br />
[321021060] Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[321022000] Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask.<br />
[321022010] Would you like to enter my service?<br />
[321022020] I see bright things in your future, stout warrior.<br />
[321022030] Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order.<br />
[321022040] And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours.<br />
[321022050] What say you? A fine accord, is it not?  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[321023000] Very well. Very well, indeed.<br />
[321023010] I knew I saw something in you.<br />
[321023020] I shall await you at my fort.<br />
[321023030] We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think.<br />
[321023040] I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[321024000] Excuse me?<br />
[321024010] Such foolishness have I never seen!<br />
[321024020] Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.<br />
[321024030] Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.<br />
[321024040] Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[321025000] What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest?  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[321026000] Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.<br />
[321026010] Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.<br />
[321026020] Oh don't fret, there's no hurry.<br />
[321026030] Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[321040000] Why...<br />
[321040010] Why the queen... Now all hope is...<br />
[321040020] (dies)  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[321050000] Ah, you, is it?<br />
[321050010] I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort?<br />
[321050020] Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler.<br />
[321050030] One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.<br />
[321050040] But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[321051000] I am sorry to have lifted your hopes...<br />
[321051010] But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand.<br />
[321051020] The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology.<br />
[321051030] But now, I must begin my search post-haste.<br />
[321051040] For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[321052000] I must begin my search post-haste.<br />
[321052010] For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[321060000] Ah, nice to see you after so long.<br />
[321060010] Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good.<br />
[321060020] Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler.<br />
[321060030] Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage.<br />
[321060040] Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less.<br />
[321060050] For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.<br />
[321060060] At which time I can fulfil my old promise.<br />
[321060070] By raising you to the glory of knighthood.<br />
[321060080] I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[321061000] For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.<br />
[321061010] At which time I can fulfil my old promise.<br />
[321061020] By raising you to the glory of knighthood.<br />
[321061030] I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.  </p>

<p>[322001000] Greetings, great champion called by grace.<br />
[322001010] I am Fia.<br />
[322001020] Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[322001030] Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?<br />
[322001040] Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.<br />
[322001050] Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion.<br />
[322001060] And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.<br />
[322001070] Do you think it vulgar, perhaps?<br />
[322001080] Where I come from, it is a sacred act.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[322002000] Ah, my thanks, great champion.<br />
[322002010] You are...very warm...<br />
[322002020] What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing.<br />
[322002030] Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.<br />
[322002040] Come back to me, should you require another.<br />
[322002050] I will take you in my arms as often as you need.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[322003000] I understand.<br />
[322003010] Your disdain is only natural.<br />
[322003020] But should you change your mind...<br />
[322003030] Come pay me another visit.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[322004000] Oh, my dear...<br />
[322004010] Had a change of heart already?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[322005000] I am pleased to see you again.<br />
[322005010] Would you like me to hold you, once more?<br />
[322005020] The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear.<br />
[322005030] Would you like to be held, regardless?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[322006000] Now, come closer...<br />
[322006010] You are so...very warm...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[322007000] Then good day to you, my dear.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[322020000] I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.<br />
[322020010] After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions,<br />
[322020020] I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.<br />
[322020030] To do so is the purpose of my being.<br />
[322020040] But before I could bear the noble into new life,<br />
[322020050] I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.<br />
[322020060] Pray, be kind.<br />
[322020070] Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.<br />
[322020080] So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[322021000] My dear...<br />
[322021010] Might I ask something of you?<br />
[322021020] Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them?<br />
[322021030] A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.<br />
[322021040] It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.<br />
[322021050] So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[322022000] I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them.<br />
[322022010] It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[322023000] My dear...<br />
[322023010] Have you ever heard of black knifeprints?<br />
[322023020] Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed.<br />
[322023030] And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.<br />
[322023040] The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,<br />
[322023050] along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.<br />
[322023060] These grand affairs are hardly my forté...<br />
[322023070] But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[322024000] Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed.<br />
[322024010] The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.<br />
[322024020] The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,<br />
[322024030] along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[322025000] I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier.<br />
[322025010] He seemed positively elated.<br />
[322025020] He must be possessed of great mental fortitude.<br />
[322025030] It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds.<br />
[322025040] You truly are a champion.<br />
[322025050] To dear Rogier, and myself, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[322027000] In truth I've heard tell from someone else,<br />
[322027010] about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.<br />
[322027020] But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[322027030] Perhaps you could make use of it?  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[322030000] Finally, it is returned to its rightful place.<br />
[322030010] The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble.<br />
[322030020] And now, I must bid you goodbye as well.<br />
[322030030] Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[322030040] I am Fia, Deathbed Companion.<br />
[322030050] Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted.<br />
[322030060] We, who humbly live in Death...<br />
[322030070] Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord.<br />
[322030080] What right does anyone have to object?<br />
[322030090] Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[322040000] Ah...there you are.<br />
[322040010] I knew you would come.<br />
[322040020] What is it you intend?<br />
[322040030] To deny us, and our ways?<br />
[322040040] Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[322041000] I see. Then you must kill me.<br />
[322041010] For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death.<br />
[322041020] I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[322041030] So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them...<br />
[322041040] I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[322042000] Go on, kill me.<br />
[322042010] You deny us, do you not?<br />
[322042020] Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[322043000] You are an odd one.<br />
[322043010] I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[322043020] They call me a foul and rotten witch.<br />
[322043030] Yet you still wish to be held by me?  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[322044000] I will soon lay with Godwyn.<br />
[322044010] And it will surely stir within me.<br />
[322044020] the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods,<br />
[322044030] as the rune of Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[322044040] Please, do one thing for me.<br />
[322044050] Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne.<br />
[322044060] Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[322044070] By becoming our Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[322045000] I will soon lay with Godwyn.<br />
[322045010] To conceive my child, the rune.<br />
[322045020] Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne.<br />
[322045030] Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.<br />
[322045040] By becoming our Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[322046000] This is goodbye, my dear.<br />
[322046010] But I am satisfied.<br />
[322046020] I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me.<br />
[322046030] And I will bear a child.<br />
[322046040] Who will inherit your warmth, too.<br />
[322046050] What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[322051000] Have you ever seen a hallowbrand?<br />
[322051010] When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede.<br />
[322051020] Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[322051030] But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere.<br />
[322051040] And I must find it.<br />
[322051050] Before the time comes we receive our Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[322052000] When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.<br />
[322052010] But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.<br />
[322052020] And I must find it.<br />
[322052030] Before the time comes we receive our Lord.<br />
[322052040] My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed.<br />
[322052050] Will you still let me hold you, even then?  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[322053000] When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.<br />
[322053010] But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.<br />
[322053020] And I must find it.<br />
[322053030] Before the time comes we receive our Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[322054000] ...!<br />
[322054010] This...is the other hallowbrand.<br />
[322054020] How did you...<br />
[322054030] Oh, my utmost thanks.<br />
[322054040] With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead.<br />
[322054050] And claim a second, illustrious life.<br />
[322054060] You are my-- our true champion.<br />
[322054070] And though I can't be of any use to you...<br />
[322054080] Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment?  </p>
<h3>3228</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[322800000] Godwyn...<br />
[322800010] Is that you, dear?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[322801000] Will your kind never stop?<br />
[322801010] Ravaging...the weak?  </p>
<h3>3229</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[322900000]  <br />
[322900010]    </p>
<h3>Dung Eater [3230]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[323001000] Have you ever felt the curse, with your whole being?<br />
[323001010] The pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all. The reviled blessing.<br />
[323001020] ...<br />
[323001030] Apparently not.<br />
[323001040] You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant of your own ignorance.<br />
[323001050] You no longer interest me.<br />
[323001060] I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[323002000] I asked you not to disturb me.<br />
[323002010] Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.<br />
[323002020] It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[323010000] No, wait.<br />
[323010010] ...<br />
[323010020] You have felt the curse.<br />
[323010030] I can smell it on you. The pox, yet tender.<br />
[323010040] Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting.<br />
[323010050] Twas a brief respite, I must say.<br />
[323010060] Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.<br />
[323010070] Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.<br />
[323010080] I can kill you, and defile your corpse.<br />
[323010090] Then the pox will truly be your own.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[323011000] Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.<br />
[323011010] Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.<br />
[323011020] I can kill you, and defile your corpse.<br />
[323011030] Then the pox will truly be your own.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[323020000] ...<br />
[323020010] Let me out! Let me out of here!<br />
[323020020] Must eat more! Defile more!<br />
[323020030] Everything that matters to you!<br />
[323020040] For generations to come!<br />
[323020050] I am the Dung Eater!<br />
[323020060] A scourge upon the living!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[323021000] Who are you?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[323022000] I've been here long enough.<br />
[323022010] I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.<br />
[323022020] Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…<br />
[323022030] They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[323023000] I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.<br />
[323023010] Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…<br />
[323023020] They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[323024000] I am the Dung Eater.<br />
[323024010] A scourge upon the living.<br />
[323024020] I must eat more. Defile more...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[323025000] Let me out. Let me out of here.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[323030000] I will kill you, and defile your corpse.<br />
[323030010] Then the pox will truly be your own.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[323031000] I'll give you a good blessing.<br />
[323031010] You'll be nourishment for the pox.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[323040000] There you are.<br />
[323040010] You warded off my blessing.<br />
[323040020] Despite the curse stirring within you.<br />
[323040030] No one has succeeded in that before.<br />
[323040040] How? I thought. Then it hit me.<br />
[323040050] That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater.<br />
[323040060] It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[323041000] Give me your blessing.<br />
[323041010] Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.<br />
[323041020] Again and again. Until it is done.<br />
[323041030] Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.<br />
[323041040] Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled.<br />
[323041050] And soon the fruits will be borne.<br />
[323041060] Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more.<br />
[323041070] A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead!<br />
[323041080] The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[323042000] My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.<br />
[323042010] Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.<br />
[323042020] Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[323050000] Uur...urgh...<br />
[323050010] A curse... A curse upon them all.<br />
[323050020] They'll be born cursed, all of them.<br />
[323050030] Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come…  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[323051000] Uur...urgh...<br />
[323051010] Curse you, Golden Order.<br />
[323051020] One day, you'll get what's coming.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[323055000] Ah...argh...<br />
[323055010] No... I am... the Dung Eater...<br />
[323055020] I am...<br />
[323055030] ...  </p>

<h3>Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing [3240]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[324001000] Oh, this is a rare occasion.<br />
[324001010] I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.<br />
[324001020] Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome.<br />
[324001030] It is safe here. You may let down your guard.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[324002000] Allow me a word of advice, as your senior.<br />
[324002010] You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.<br />
[324002020] A house guest, yet to earn their keep.<br />
[324002030] Remember your place, newcomer.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[324003000] There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[324010000] What do you need? I have little time to spare.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[324011000] Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?<br />
[324011010] Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.<br />
[324011020] Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.<br />
[324011030] If those words held any meaning to you...<br />
[324011040] Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.<br />
[324011050] Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.<br />
[324011060] And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[324012000] Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.<br />
[324012010] As a true member of the Roundtable.<br />
[324012020] I have high hopes for you.<br />
[324012030] I'm sick and tired of them.<br />
[324012040] These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[324013000] We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[324015000] If you haven't anything to say, I would prefer you didn't pester me for attention.<br />
[324015010] Try not to make a spectacle of yourself either. Or are you as irredeemably foolish as you appear?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[324020000] You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?<br />
[324020010] Then just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.<br />
[324020020] I am known as Gideon Ofnir.<br />
[324020030] As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,<br />
[324020040] I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.<br />
[324020050] You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[324021000] You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh?<br />
[324021010] Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge.<br />
[324021020] The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers.<br />
[324021030] We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.<br />
[324021040] Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
[324021050] General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[324021060] Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir.<br />
[324021070] Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.<br />
[324021080] And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.<br />
[324021090] ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[324022000] So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
[324022010] Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.<br />
[324022020] His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.<br />
[324022030] ...but I suspect you know that well enough already.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[324023000] General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.<br />
[324023010] He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.<br />
[324023020] And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.<br />
[324023030] I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.<br />
[324023040] And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.<br />
[324023050] Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[324024000] Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.<br />
[324024010] He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.<br />
[324024020] The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree.<br />
[324024030] It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.<br />
[324024040] Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[324025000] Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.<br />
[324025010] It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.<br />
[324025020] But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.<br />
[324025030] Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.<br />
[324025040] Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[324026000] The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.<br />
[324026010] Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.<br />
[324026020] But Rennala herself is no demigod.<br />
[324026030] She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon,<br />
[324026040] Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.<br />
[324026050] The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[324027000] There are four more demigods yet to be located.<br />
[324027010] Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed.<br />
[324027020] His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.<br />
[324027030] Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala.<br />
[324027040] And the one only known as the Lord of Blood.<br />
[324027050] Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune,<br />
[324027060] so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.<br />
[324027070] If you should learn anything of these matters,<br />
[324027080] I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me.<br />
[324027090] We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.<br />
[324027100] As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.<br />
[324027580] I'll trade your findings for something rather special.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[324030000] Ah, you. What is it?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[324031000] Well...what is it now?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[324032000] Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.<br />
[324032010] Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.<br />
[324032020] Make the journey.<br />
[324032030] To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
[324032040] The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.<br />
[324032050] You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.<br />
[324032060] For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[324033000] Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
[324033010] The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.<br />
[324033020] You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[324035000] General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.<br />
[324035010] He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.<br />
[324035020] And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now.<br />
[324035030] Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[324036000] Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.<br />
[324036010] It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.<br />
[324036020] But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.<br />
[324036030] Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[324037000] The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.<br />
[324037010] Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.<br />
[324037020] And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[324038000] You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?<br />
[324038010] Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.<br />
[324038020] I am known as Gideon Ofnir.<br />
[324038030] As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,<br />
[324038040] I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.<br />
[324038050] You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[324040000] I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli.<br />
[324040010] She is my daughter.<br />
[324040020] I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace.<br />
[324040030] Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.<br />
[324040040] So I put her to work.<br />
[324040050] Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.<br />
[324040060] Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[324041000] Ahh, you've already heard?<br />
[324041010] Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions.<br />
[324041020] So I had no further use for her.<br />
[324041030] Honestly, what's a man to do.<br />
[324041040] A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.<br />
[324041050] I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.<br />
[324041060] A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[324042000] Is that potion what I think it is?<br />
[324042010] Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.<br />
[324042020] Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must.<br />
[324042030] The Roundtable has no code to speak of.<br />
[324042040] But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?<br />
[324042050] Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[324043000] Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.<br />
[324043010] You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.<br />
[324043020] Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.<br />
[324043030] Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.<br />
[324043040] His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[324044000] Well, I won't force you.<br />
[324044010] But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.<br />
[324044020] She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.<br />
[324044030] Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[324045000] I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.<br />
[324045010] Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.<br />
[324045020] Sorry. For the time you had to waste.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[324046000] Well, I won't force you.<br />
[324046010] If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you.<br />
[324046020] Not that I could fathom why you'd want to...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[324050000] Oh, my apologies for that nasty business.<br />
[324050010] Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems.<br />
[324050020] As his master, I'd like to express my regret.<br />
[324050030] But now, Ensha is slain and gone.<br />
[324050040] Finished, forever more.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[324051000] Ah, yes, by way of apology,<br />
[324051010] allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.<br />
[324051020] Find the Albinauric woman.<br />
[324051030] She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,<br />
[324051040] She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.<br />
[324051050] together with her great wolf.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[324052000] Find the Albinauric woman.<br />
[324052010] She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,<br />
[324052020] She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.<br />
[324052030] together with her great wolf.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[324053000] Ah, yes, by way of apology,<br />
[324053010] allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.<br />
[324053020] Find the village of the Albinaurics.<br />
[324053030] It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.<br />
[324053040] And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[324054000] Find the village of the Albinaurics.<br />
[324054010] It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.<br />
[324054020] Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.   </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[324060000] Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you.<br />
[324060010] To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
[324060020] Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.<br />
[324060030] Hah, no need to pay me for that gift.<br />
[324060040] All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance.<br />
[324060050] That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.<br />
[324060060] It doesn't have to be me, my fellow.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[324061000] If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
[324061010] You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.<br />
[324061020] I marked your map with its location.<br />
[324061030] Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".<br />
[324061040] The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[324070000] Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.<br />
[324070010] I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.<br />
[324070020] You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...<br />
[324070030] Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.<br />
[324070040] I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?<br />
[324070050] Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[324071000] Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree?<br />
[324071010] I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.<br />
[324071020] Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.<br />
[324071030] But...with the Haligtree as it is...<br />
[324071040] I suppose Miquella must already be...  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[324072000] Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.<br />
[324072010] The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:<br />
[324072020] A hidden treasure, known only to me.<br />
[324072030] A secret rite known only to me.<br />
[324072040] You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.<br />
[324072530] And it is a wondrous thing indeed.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[324073000] So. The Haligtree, now but a husk...<br />
[324073010] I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,<br />
[324073020] but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.<br />
[324073030] Indeed, it seems those words held weight.<br />
[324073040] How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...<br />
[324073050] Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[324074000] Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.<br />
[324074010] A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.<br />
[324074020] Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.<br />
[324074030] But perhaps it's worth looking into...<br />
[324074040] If what I've heard is right, then maybe...  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[324075000] Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!<br />
[324075010] That is some fine intelligence indeed!<br />
[324075020] With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.<br />
[324075030] One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.<br />
[324075040] As promised, allow me to impart to you<br />
[324075050] the last of the hidden treasures known only to me.<br />
[324075060] the last of the secret rites known only to me.<br />
[324075070] a thing most wondrous, known only to me.  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[324076000] Well, I wonder what comes next...<br />
[324076010] If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.<br />
[324076020] But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.<br />
[324076030] Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...  </p>
<h4>Section 77</h4>
<p>[324077000] You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?<br />
[324077010] Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.<br />
[324077020] Ah, no need to fret about that.<br />
[324077030] The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.<br />
[324077040] And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,<br />
[324077050] then the Roundtable must go, as well.  </p>
<h4>Section 78</h4>
<p>[324078000] I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.<br />
[324078010] I must learn all that can be taken from this place,<br />
[324078020] and sear it into my memory.<br />
[324078030] How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less?  </p>
<h4>Section 79</h4>
<p>[324079000] The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.<br />
[324079010] Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.<br />
[324079020] Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.<br />
[324079030] Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?<br />
[324079040] What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[324080000] Ahh, I knew you'd come.<br />
[324080010] To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.<br />
[324080020] What a sad state of affairs.<br />
[324080030] I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.<br />
[324080040] Queen Marika has high hopes for us.<br />
[324080050] That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.  </p>
<h3>3241</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[324100000] You think I don't know what that is?<br />
[324100010] I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at.<br />
[324100020] You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.  </p>
<h3>3248</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[324800000] My fellow, you've fought well, until now.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[324801000] I know...in my bones...<br />
[324801010] A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.<br />
[324801020] A man cannot kill a god...  </p>
<h3>3249</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[324900000]  <br />
[324900100] Knowledge above all!<br />
[324900200]  <br />
[324900300]    </p>
<h3>Sorcerer Rogier [3250]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[325001000] Ah, nice to meet you.<br />
[325001010] The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.<br />
[325001020] I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.<br />
[325001030] When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.<br />
[325001040] But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?<br />
[325001050] This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.<br />
[325001060] Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[325002000] I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?<br />
[325002010] You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.<br />
[325002020] Well, enjoy it while you can.<br />
[325002030] I'm Tarnished, like you.<br />
[325002040] But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.<br />
[325002050] Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.<br />
[325002060] I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
[325002070] Would you care to learn one?<br />
[325002080] As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[325003000] Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[325004000] Oh hello there, good to see you safe.<br />
[325004010] Stopping by to learn a battle art or two?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[325005000] The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.<br />
[325005010] They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.<br />
[325005020] In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.<br />
[325005030] Fascinating, isn't it?<br />
[325005040] That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.<br />
[325005050] With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,<br />
[325005060] such adaptability is more important now than ever.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[325006000] Of course. I understand.<br />
[325006010] Why place trust in a perfect stranger?<br />
[325006020] Be safe, then, stranger.<br />
[325006030] Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[325007000] Oh? Something bothering you?<br />
[325007010] Or are you just trying to pass the time?<br />
[325007020] I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[325020000] Ah, we meet again after all.<br />
[325020010] I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.<br />
[325020020] So. What do you need?  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[325021000] Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.<br />
[325021010] Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.<br />
[325021020] Well done, friend.<br />
[325021030] Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.<br />
[325021040] As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.<br />
[325021050] No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[325022000] The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?<br />
[325022010] That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.<br />
[325022020] It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.<br />
[325022030] Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.<br />
[325022040] And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.<br />
[325022050] That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.<br />
[325022060] And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.<br />
[325022070] I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.<br />
[325022080] The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,<br />
[325022090] You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[325023000] This...is a black knifeprint!<br />
[325023010] I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!<br />
[325023020] You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?<br />
[325023030] They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.<br />
[325023040] A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.<br />
[325023050] The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.<br />
[325023060] Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.<br />
[325023070] I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.<br />
[325023080] Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.<br />
[325023090] Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...<br />
[325023100] Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[325024000] Oh, still need something?  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[325026000] Always good to see you safe.<br />
[325026010] So. What do you need?  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[325027000] Ah, so you've met D.<br />
[325027010] D is an old friend.<br />
[325027020] We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.<br />
[325027030] But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.<br />
[325027040] Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[325028000] Pleased to meet you.<br />
[325028010] The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.<br />
[325028020] But now I'm in this sorry state.<br />
[325028030] I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.<br />
[325028040] As you might guess, it's far from ideal...  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[325029000] Ah, I know.<br />
[325029010] I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
[325029020] Would you care to learn one?<br />
[325029030] Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.<br />
[325029040] A little conversation goes a long way.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[325030000] Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.<br />
[325030010] My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.<br />
[325030020] Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
[325030030] Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla.<br />
[325030040] Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.<br />
[325030050] Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.<br />
[325030060] Truly, you have my thanks.<br />
[325030070] But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.<br />
[325030080] If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
[325030090] then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
[325030100] I would like you to procure it for me.<br />
[325030110] And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.<br />
[325030120] Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace.<br />
[325030130] If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,<br />
[325030140] The answers you find will surely bolster your chances.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[325031000] I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.<br />
[325031010] There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[325031020] It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.<br />
[325031030] There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years<br />
[325031040] Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.<br />
[325031050] But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[325032000] If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
[325032010] then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
[325032020] Would you be willing to procure it for me?<br />
[325032030] She may have returned to the manor that is her home.<br />
[325032040] The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[325033000] I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.<br />
[325033010] Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?<br />
[325033020] The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.<br />
[325033030] By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.<br />
[325033040] But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.<br />
[325033050] You may find this peculiar,<br />
[325033060] but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
[325033070] These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[325034000] Yes, indeed.<br />
[325034010] If D knew what drives me now,<br />
[325034020] he would surely boil over with rage.<br />
[325034030] Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.<br />
[325034040] But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.<br />
[325034050] I can tell a good lie when I need to.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[325035000] And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...<br />
[325035010] I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[325036000] Oh? Forgot something, did you?  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[325037000] Alright there. Good to see you safe.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[325040000] I see...<br />
[325040010] When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.<br />
[325040020] You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...<br />
[325040030] But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...<br />
[325040040] Then perhaps it's true after all.<br />
[325040050] Hmm.<br />
[325040060] Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...<br />
[325040070] How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?<br />
[325040080] Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.<br />
[325040090] The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.<br />
[325040100] And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.<br />
[325040110] I know you've got what it takes.<br />
[325040120] Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[325041000] Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?<br />
[325041010] While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.<br />
[325041020] And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.<br />
[325041030] I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.<br />
[325041040] But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.<br />
[325041050] Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[325045000] D was telling me.<br />
[325045010] That he discovered the mark of the centipede.<br />
[325045020] The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.<br />
[325045030] As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,<br />
[325045040] then we may be able to form an alliance.<br />
[325045050] If only I could speak to them in person.<br />
[325045060] And if they were like you, all the better.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[325046000] Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.<br />
[325046010] Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...<br />
[325046020] Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.<br />
[325046030] And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.<br />
[325046040] So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.<br />
[325046050] Since you're so scary and all.  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[325100000] For me, really?<br />
[325100010] Why thank you very much.<br />
[325100020] I'll try anything once.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[325101000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[325102000] ...No thank you.<br />
[325102010] I don't need your pity.<br />
[325102020] Ah...<br />
[325102030] Sorry. You were only trying to be nice.<br />
[325102040] It would be my pleasure to take it. My thanks.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>

<h3>3258</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[325800000] Oof!<br />
[325800010] I fear you are mistaken.<br />
[325800020] I am no foe of yours, far from it.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[325801000] This is rather unfortunate.<br />
[325801010] I don't normally find myself cornered like a rat.<br />
[325801020] But I have my ways...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[325802000] No need to grandstand; you're not even on stage.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[325803000] Well, this is unfortunate.<br />
[325803010] Couldn't change a thing...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[325810000] Agh!<br />
[325810010] I fear you are mistaken.<br />
[325810020] I am no foe of yours, far from it.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[325811000] If you think I am helpless,<br />
[325811010] you are quite mistaken, I'm afraid.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[325812000] If this doesn't cause you shame, nothing will.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[325813000] Well, this is unfortunate.<br />
[325813010] Couldn't change a thing...  </p>

<h3>Recusant Bernahl [3260]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[326001000] Not seen you before.<br />
[326001010] Name's Bernahl. Tarnished, just like you.<br />
[326001020] Let me ask you something.<br />
[326001030] Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight?<br />
[326001040] Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm,<br />
[326001050] despite the collapse of the Golden Order?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[326002000] Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through.<br />
[326002010] Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever.<br />
[326002020] Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?<br />
[326002030] All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.<br />
[326002040] Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[326003000] Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[326004000] Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe.<br />
[326004010] Here to learn a battle art or two?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[326005000] There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover.<br />
[326005010] Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died.<br />
[326005020] A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance.<br />
[326005030] That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat.<br />
[326005040] It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[326006000] Honest to a fault, I see.<br />
[326006010] Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished.<br />
[326006020] But there's nothing wrong with that.<br />
[326006030] Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?<br />
[326006040] All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.<br />
[326006050] Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[326007000] Not floating your boat, eh?<br />
[326007010] Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[326008000] There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts?  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[326009000] Well, until we meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[326010000] You...<br />
[326010010] What in heaven's name are you doing here?<br />
[326010020] The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.<br />
[326010030] I hope you understand the weight of my words.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[326011000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.<br />
[326011010] I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue.<br />
[326011020] Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.<br />
[326011030] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.<br />
[326011040] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[326012000] This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death.<br />
[326012010] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[326013000] So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt.<br />
[326013010] Then I shall introduce myself once more.<br />
[326013020] Bernahl, a recusant, just like you.<br />
[326013030] Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.<br />
[326013040] Why not add some to your repertoire?  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[326014000] Oh, not had your fill, eh?  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[326015000] You're still alive, I see.<br />
[326015010] Why not learn another battle art, see if we can't keep it that way.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[326016000] You've come to understand, now, eh?<br />
[326016010] To take power and make it his own,<br />
[326016020] The recusant must hunt his own kind.<br />
[326016030] To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging,<br />
[326016040] We recusants must become the most wretched of predators.<br />
[326016050] All you can do is laugh.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[326017000] Look at you. A recusant through and through.<br />
[326017010] I knew you had it in you.<br />
[326017020] Take this.<br />
[326017030] A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[326017040] If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[326018000] Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return.<br />
[326018010] I have the reward from Lady Tanith.<br />
[326018020] Take it. It's yours, by right.<br />
[326018030] Let us tread the path of the recusant together.<br />
[326018040] Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[326020000] So. You killed Rykard?<br />
[326020010] I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.<br />
[326020020] Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.<br />
[326020030] But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more.<br />
[326020040] Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.<br />
[326020050] We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs.<br />
[326020060] And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[326021000] O Greater Will, hear my voice.<br />
[326021010] I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.<br />
[326021020] We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[326030000] Who are you?<br />
[326030010] And what in heaven's name are you doing here?<br />
[326030020] The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.<br />
[326030030] I hope you understand the weight of my words.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[326040000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.<br />
[326040010] You have harboured doubts from the very beginning.<br />
[326040020] Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon.<br />
[326040030] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.<br />
[326040040] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[326041000] Then you must leave immediately.<br />
[326041010] Those with weak stomachs have no place here.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[326042000] I thought I told you to leave.<br />
[326042010] Or do you claim to understand?<br />
[326042020] What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[326043000] Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.<br />
[326043010] But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.<br />
[326043020] Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.  </p>
<h3>3261</h3>

<p>[326100000] Oh, a brew, is it?<br />
[326100010] Thanking me for the battle arts?<br />
[326100020] You're one of the good ones. Thank you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[326101000] Oh, a brew, is it?<br />
[326101010] Fitting, I suppose.<br />
[326101020] For a recusant already drunk on blasphemy.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>

<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[326800000] Agh!<br />
[326800010] What's wrong with you?<br />
[326800020] I won't say it twice. Stop this.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[326801000] I suppose I have no choice, then.<br />
[326801010] Is this what grace would have of us?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[326802000] Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[326803000] You are an enigma, to be certain.<br />
[326803010] The Volcano Manor awaits you.  </p>

<h3>Miriel, Pastor of Vows [3300]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[330001000] You're Tarnished, aren't you?<br />
[330001010] I welcome you, to the Church of Vows.<br />
[330001020] I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.<br />
[330001030] My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.<br />
[330001040] Do you know the origin of this place?<br />
[330001050] How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[330002000] Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you?<br />
[330002010] The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear.<br />
[330002020] It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined.<br />
[330002030] By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon.<br />
[330002040] And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses.<br />
[330002050] The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[330003000] Oh, was there something you needed?<br />
[330003010] You are free to show yourself around.<br />
[330003020] I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be...<br />
[330003030] If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.<br />
[330003040] Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction?<br />
[330003050] In which case, I will share all that I know.<br />
[330003060] Whether it be sorcery or incantations, learning should not fetter you to one side or the other.<br />
[330003070] This is, after all, a church celebrating the union of two such opposed practitioners.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[330004000] Is there something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[330010000] Greetings. Do you need anything?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[330011000] Do you possess any celestial dew?<br />
[330011010] Then I would like to share my knowledge with you.<br />
[330011020] Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.<br />
[330011030] Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew,<br />
[330011040] repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala.<br />
[330011050] The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.<br />
[330011060] This miracle blesses the church to this day.<br />
[330011070] And so, you need only follow Radagon's example,<br />
[330011080] to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[330012000] My faith does not waver.<br />
[330012010] The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world.<br />
[330012020] And this time, its bounty will not be squandered.<br />
[330012030] If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished,<br />
[330012040] I hope that you, too, will share my faith.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[330014000] Are you taking the sword with you?<br />
[330014010] Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you.<br />
[330014020] Clearly, you are no conniving thief.<br />
[330014030] The sword is telling us something, no doubt.<br />
[330014040] Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground,<br />
[330014050] it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand.<br />
[330014060] Ah, now I recall.<br />
[330014070] As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you.<br />
[330014080] May you hold it high and proud.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[330020000] Are you quite finished?<br />
[330020010] Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions.<br />
[330020020] Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving.<br />
[330020030] Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain.<br />
[330020040] And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[330021000] Are you quite finished?<br />
[330021010] I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright.<br />
[330021020] Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.<br />
[330021030] My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.<br />
[330021040] Do you know the origin of this place?<br />
[330021050] How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[330022000] Are you quite finished, now?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[330031000] To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew.<br />
[330031010] Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[330033000] Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds.<br />
[330033010] Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed...<br />
[330033020] Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony.<br />
[330033030] Be mindful, not to take for granted...<br />
[330033040] the serenity restored by this miracle.<br />
[330033050] And take care. Never to break a bond again.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[330050000] You wish to know more of Lord Radagon?<br />
[330050010] Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks.<br />
[330050020] He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.<br />
[330050030] He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.<br />
[330050040] However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between,<br />
[330050050] Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort.<br />
[330050060] Taking the title...of second Elden Lord.<br />
[330050070] The mystery endures, to this day...<br />
[330050080] As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside...<br />
[330050090] And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[330051000] You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret...<br />
[330051010] A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature.<br />
[330051020] When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet.<br />
[330051030] And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[330052000] You wish to know more of Lady Rennala?<br />
[330052010] She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[330052020] The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch.<br />
[330052030] Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.<br />
[330052040] And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[330053000] In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her.<br />
[330053010] Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite;<br />
[330053020] the grim art of reincarnation.<br />
[330053030] You would do well to remember...<br />
[330053040] Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[330060000] Why, this is nectar, is it not?<br />
[330060010] And you're giving it to me?<br />
[330060020] Oh, wonderful, just wonderful.<br />
[330060030] Truth be told, I'm rather fond of the stuff.<br />
[330060040] I'll happily take it off your hands!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[330061000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h3>3301</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[330100000] Oh, what have we here?<br />
[330100010] Very well, let us both learn together.<br />
[330100020] Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance.<br />
[330100030] All things can be conjoined.  </p>
<h3>3308</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[330800000] Mngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[330801000] Stop it, please.<br />
[330801010] My flesh is akin to stone.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[330802000] I cannot be wounded. I cannot die.<br />
[330802010] But nor will I cause any harm unto you.<br />
[330802020] Cease your futile efforts.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[330803000] Well, aren't we determined.<br />
[330803010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[330804000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[330805000] Aaa...aaargh!  </p>
<h3>Blackguard [3310]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[331001000] What are you lookin' at?<br />
[331001010] You trying to start something, mate?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[331002000] Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it?<br />
[331002010] Hmm, well…<br />
[331002020] Show me what it's worth to you,<br />
[331002030] and I'll consider parting ways with it.<br />
[331002040] I'm not in love with it or nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[331003000] You're a shrewd one, chief.<br />
[331003010] First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither.<br />
[331003020] Hmm...<br />
[331003030] Alright. Take it.<br />
[331003040] Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway.<br />
[331003050] Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[331004000] Oh piss off, what is it now?<br />
[331004010] Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn?<br />
[331004020] Freshly cooked, it is.<br />
[331004030] Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price.<br />
[331004040] I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[331005000] What the hell is wrong with you.<br />
[331005010] You trying to start something?<br />
[331005020] Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[331006000] This bloody swine...<br />
[331006010] Decided to play ball now, 'ave you?<br />
[331006110] You'll be wantin' the necklace, then?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[331007000] Think you're bloody clever, do ya?<br />
[331007010] Then how about you piss off?<br />
[331007110] fore I crack you in 'alf.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[331010000] Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[331011000] Alright mate. Want some more prawn, do ya?<br />
[331011010] Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[331012000] Never met someone with a taste for prawn I couldn't trust.<br />
[331012010] We'd make good mates, I reckon.<br />
[331012020] I'll be seeing ya.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[331015000] Oh, so you met the girl, did ya?<br />
[331015010] Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter,<br />
[331015020] But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it.<br />
[331015030] Anyway, she ain't all right, that one.<br />
[331015040] Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[331016000] You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha?<br />
[331016010] Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean.<br />
[331016020] I can't see it at all no more.<br />
[331016030] Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between.<br />
[331016040] Cruel bloody joke, you ask me.<br />
[331016050] Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time.<br />
[331016060] The Erdtree, I'm sayin'.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[331017000] You what? Sod the particulars, mate.<br />
[331017010] Ain't my fault people are so bloody stupid, is it?<br />
[331017020] Don't like that it's stolen? Don't sodding buy it..  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[331020000] What are you lookin' at?<br />
[331020010] Oh...you again, is it.<br />
[331020020] Perfect bloody timing, actually.<br />
[331020030] I got crab, cooked up fresh.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[331021000] Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[331022000] Alright mate. Want some more crab, do ya?<br />
[331022010] Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya?  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[331023000] Never met someone with a taste for crab I couldn't trust.<br />
[331023010] We've got a real thing here, eh, and it's only gettin' better.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[331025000] Mate, there's somethin' I should probably tell ya.<br />
[331025010] You 'eard of the Dung Eater?<br />
[331025020] E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all.<br />
[331025030] You see 'im though, stay well away.<br />
[331025040] I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and.<br />
[331025050] E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[331026000] E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls...<br />
[331026010] Does all sorts of shit to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever.<br />
[331026020] I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years.<br />
[331026030] I ain't ever been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot...<br />
[331026040] While 'e did all that, to my friend...  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[331027000] Yeah...and now I seen it 'ere, again.<br />
[331027010] Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies.<br />
[331027020] It was... It was 'im, no question.<br />
[331027030] That monster. He's lurkin' round 'ere.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[331030000] Heh...serves me right.<br />
[331030010] Fitting bloody end, for a jumped up little shit with big ideas...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[331031000] Help me out, would ya, mate...<br />
[331031010] I don't wanna get cursed. Just let me die...<br />
[331031020] I don't wanna live like this...not anymore...<br />
[331031030] So, please...<br />
[331031040] ...  </p>
<h3>3318</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[331800000] Oof!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[331801000] What's your blinkin' problem!<br />
[331801010] You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[331802000] That bitch put you up to this, eh.<br />
[331802010] Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[331803000] Not scared, are ya.<br />
[331803010] Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[331804000] You feel that, eh?<br />
[331804010] That's the fists of Big Boggart.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[331805000] Goddamn it.<br />
[331805010] Why ain't it me, why ain't it ever...  </p>
<h3>3319</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[331900000]  <br />
[331900010]  <br />
[331900020]    </p>
<h3>3320</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[332001000] <sigh><br />
[332001010] Someone, please, kill him...<br />
[332001020] That horrendous serpent... Praetor Rykard...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[332002000] Mm, you're Tarnished.<br />
[332002010] Here to put the demigods to the sword.<br />
[332002020] Then please. Kill the great serpent.<br />
[332002030] The one that devoured Praetor Rykard.<br />
[332002040] I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.<br />
[332002050] Worthy Tarnished, brandish the spear, and run him through.<br />
[332002060] The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[332003000] Praetor Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign.<br />
[332003010] But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity, once he gave himself to the serpent.<br />
[332003020] Whatever that thing is, it is no longer Praetor Rykard.<br />
[332003030] Someone must kill him.<br />
[332003040] To spare him, and his ambitions, from further dishonour.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[332004000] Worthy Tarnished. I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.<br />
[332004010] It is the only thing that can kill that horror.<br />
[332004020] Run it through. The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity...  </p>
<h3>Sorcerer Thops [3330]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[333001000] You're Tarnished, aren't you?<br />
[333001010] Then, perhaps you could spare some runes?<br />
[333001020] Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[333001030] For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[333002000] Well, bless you, bless you.<br />
[333002010] You are a true saint.<br />
[333002020] My name is Thops.<br />
[333002030] Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised.<br />
[333002040] Only, none of them are particularly great...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[333003000] Back to learn another?<br />
[333003010] Wonderful. You're most welcome, to any of my anaemic little spells.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[333004000] Back to learn another?<br />
[333004010] Why, of course.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[333005000] Well, I can't blame you, I suppose.<br />
[333005010] But, in the case that you do change your mind,<br />
[333005020] just speak up, loud and clear.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[333006000] Oh, there you are.<br />
[333006010] Care to donate a few runes?<br />
[333006020] Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[333006030] For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[333020000] Apologies, friend.<br />
[333020010] I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity.<br />
[333020020] Oh, right.<br />
[333020030] I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit.<br />
[333020040] You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?<br />
[333020050] That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.<br />
[333020060] Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.<br />
[333020070] After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,<br />
[333020080] the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.<br />
[333020100] As you might have guessed, the seals are still active,<br />
[333020110] making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.<br />
[333020120] And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.<br />
[333020130] When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[333021000] Why not find yourself a glintstone key?<br />
[333021010] Without one, you can't pass through the academy,<br />
[333021020] and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.<br />
[333021030] And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...<br />
[333021040] Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient -<br />
[333021050] would you consider donating it to me?<br />
[333021060] I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.<br />
[333021070] But still, my place is at the academy...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[333022000] Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics...<br />
[333022010] ...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City.<br />
[333022020] The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs.<br />
[333022030] And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[333023000] Thank you, kind soul.<br />
[333023010] For learning my paltry sorceries.<br />
[333023020] I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[333024000] Are you certain?<br />
[333024010] You're willing to give your glintstone key to me?<br />
[333024020] …My oh my!<br />
[333024030] Thank you, thank you dearly.<br />
[333024040] Now I can go back to the academy.<br />
[333024050] To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars.<br />
[333024060] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[333025000] You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?<br />
[333025010] Well, that is something.<br />
[333025020] Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.<br />
[333025030] I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.<br />
[333025040] But Sellen was expelled from the academy.<br />
[333025050] Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.<br />
[333025060] I still don't believe the accusations.<br />
[333025070] The illustrious Sellen would never do such things...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[333026000] Find yourself a glintstone key.<br />
[333026010] Without one, you can't pass through the academy,<br />
[333026020] and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[333030000] Well, what's this?<br />
[333030010] For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew?<br />
[333030020] My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward.<br />
[333030030] Oh, bless you.<br />
[333030040] I'll save it for a special occasion.<br />
[333030050] I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[333031000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[333040000] So, you've found yourself a glintstone key.<br />
[333040010] But I certainly can't take it from you.<br />
[333040020] That key belongs to you.<br />
[333040030] By rights, you should use it for yourself.<br />
[333040040] It's true, I wish to return to my place of study.<br />
[333040050] But that's no excuse to impose upon others.<br />
[333040060] Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[333041000] Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[333041010] Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight.<br />
[333041020] Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[333051000] Thank you dearly.<br />
[333051010] With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
[333051020] Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit?<br />
[333051030] Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then!<br />
[333051040] Ha ha!  </p>
<h3>3331</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[333100000] Oh, did I not mention?<br />
[333100010] I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power.<br />
[333100020] So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll.<br />
[333100030] I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am.  </p>
<h3>3338</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[333800000] Ow!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[333801000] What's wrong with you?<br />
[333801010] Stop that, now. Please.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[333802000] There's no getting through to you, is there.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[333803000] ...<br />
[333803010] Why on earth...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[333804000] Oh, Raya... Lucaria...<br />
[333804010] The home of my studies...  </p>
<h3>3339</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[333900000]  <br />
[333900010]  <br />
[333900020]    </p>
<h3>Nepheli Loux, Warrior [3340]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[334001000] Be proud. You were a fine warrior.<br />
[334001010] Your only mistake was your choice of master.<br />
[334001020] Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[334002000] Well, who do we have here?<br />
[334002020] Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.<br />
[334002030] I am Nepheli Loux. Tarnished and warrior, like you.<br />
[334002040] I'm here by decree of my father.<br />
[334002050] How utterly repellant this is.<br />
[334002060] This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.<br />
[334002070] He's tainted the very winds.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[334003000] If you intend to challenge Godrick,<br />
[334003010] I ask you call upon me.<br />
[334003020] The winds run foul with his deeds.<br />
[334003030] I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[334004000] Apologies, but I've idled long enough.<br />
[334004010] As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance.<br />
[334004020] Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[334010000] You again...<br />
[334010010] I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.<br />
[334010020] Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.<br />
[334010030] I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.<br />
[334010040] I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.<br />
[334010050] You defeated him. You should have it.<br />
[334010060] Make good use of it.<br />
[334010070] I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.<br />
[334010080] You again...<br />
[334010090] I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.<br />
[334010100] Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.<br />
[334010110] I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.<br />
[334010120] I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.<br />
[334010130] You were the one to defeat him, I would hazard?<br />
[334010140] Make good use of it.<br />
[334010150] I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[334011000] Ah, yes.<br />
[334011010] I wonder if you've met my foster father?<br />
[334011020] He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.<br />
[334011030] If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.<br />
[334011040] Father is leader of the Roundtable.<br />
[334011050] I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[334012000] It's about time I headed off.<br />
[334012010] I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[334018000] You again...<br />
[334018010] You received a summons to the Roundtable?<br />
[334018020] Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.<br />
[334018030] The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[334019000] Oh, hello.<br />
[334019010] I've not seen you here before.<br />
[334019020] I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.<br />
[334019030] Here by decree of my father.<br />
[334019040] The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[334020000] Is that some kind of medicine?<br />
[334020010] One that affects the heart, I'd wager.<br />
[334020020] If it's what I think, I have no need of it.<br />
[334020030] I am a warrior.<br />
[334020040] I need no external aid.<br />
[334020050] Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[334030000] Oh, it's you...<br />
[334030020] Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?<br />
[334030030] I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.<br />
[334030040] The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.<br />
[334030050] A waking nightmare, made by men.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[334031000] But this time, I'm a woman grown.<br />
[334031010] And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.<br />
[334031020] Justice to the oppressors.<br />
[334031030] Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[334040000] Ah, you...<br />
[334040010] Please, leave me be.<br />
[334040020] It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[334041000] ...So you know already, do you?<br />
[334041010] Right. It's true. My father cast me out.<br />
[334041020] For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.<br />
[334041030] Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.<br />
[334041040] I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.<br />
[334041050] And yet I... Though it was not my intent...<br />
[334041060] I betrayed him...  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[334042000] I...can no longer trust in father...<br />
[334042010] To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy...<br />
[334042020] Where is the justice he purports, in that?<br />
[334042030] He once told me that if he became Elden Lord,<br />
[334042040] he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.<br />
[334042050] Was he simply lying to me?  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[334043000] No, no, no...<br />
[334043010] How could I say that?<br />
[334043020] Father has always given me his guidance...<br />
[334043030] And now...I've lost it...<br />
[334043040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[334050000] Medicine, is it?<br />
[334050010] Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good.<br />
[334050020] ...<br />
[334050030] It's very sweet...isn't it...<br />
[334050040] And very...very...<br />
[334050050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[334060000] Is that ash?<br />
[334060010] I can smell the ancient storm in it...<br />
[334060030] My thanks. I'll gladly take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[334061000] I'm...not like Roderika.<br />
[334061010] I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.<br />
[334061020] Still, this ash..<br />
[334061030] It reminds me of my first hawk.<br />
[334061040] Thank you.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[334062000] In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.<br />
[334062010] It reminds me of my first hawk.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[334070000] It's been some time.<br />
[334070010] I must thank you, for your aid.<br />
[334070020] I told father I would be with him no longer.<br />
[334070030] I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.<br />
[334070040] This land is much like the one from which I hail.<br />
[334070050] I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[334071000] Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.<br />
[334071010] Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.<br />
[334071020] Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.<br />
[334071030] I cannot express how much you've helped me.<br />
[334071040] Should you become Elden Lord.<br />
[334071050] I would gladly lighten your burden.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[334072000] Farewell, fellow warrior.<br />
[334072010] I will remain, to summon the storm.<br />
[334072020] But your guidance, and your fight...<br />
[334072030] Surely lie elsewhere.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[334073000] I will remain, to summon the storm.<br />
[334073010] But your guidance, and your fight...<br />
[334073020] Surely lie elsewhere.  </p>
<h3>3348</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[334800000]    </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[334801000] What do you intend?<br />
[334801010] Such conduct ill befits a warrior.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[334802000] I see. You are but a simple villain.<br />
[334802010] Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[334803000] You wouldn't even register as a threat to father.<br />
[334803010] Hurry up and die.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[334804000] Father... I am slain.<br />
[334804010] Please...become Elden Lord...  </p>
<h3>3349</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[334900000]  <br />
[334900010]  <br />
[334900020]    </p>
<h3>Reeling Rico [3350]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[335001000] Hm.<br />
[335001010] A new face, are you?<br />
[335001020] Well, while you're here. Have you, too, been seduced by the good lady alcohol?<br />
[335001030] Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?<br />
[335001040] Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.<br />
[335001050] And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,<br />
[335001060] I'd gladly share some with you.<br />
[335001070] The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished.<br />
[335001080] And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[335002000] You'll help me then?<br />
[335002010] Wonderful! Music to my ears.<br />
[335002020] Then take this with you.<br />
[335002030] That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball.<br />
[335002040] It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep,<br />
[335002050] those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken.<br />
[335002060] Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[335003000] Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer.<br />
[335003010] About two should do it, by my reckoning...<br />
[335003020] About three should do it, by my reckoning...<br />
[335003030] About four should do it, by my reckoning...<br />
[335003040] About five should do it, by my reckoning...<br />
[335003050] About six should do it, by my reckoning...<br />
[335003060] And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share.<br />
[335003070] Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand; this world's delights, and its futility.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[335004000] You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on.<br />
[335004010] Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long.<br />
[335004020] Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world...<br />
[335004030] Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[335005000] What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all?<br />
[335005010] Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?<br />
[335005020] Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.<br />
[335005030] And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,<br />
[335005040] I'd gladly share some with you.<br />
[335005050] What do you say?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[335010000] Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return.<br />
[335010010] How did you fare? Find any slumber fog?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[335011000] Hmm, not quite enough.<br />
[335011010] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.<br />
[335011020] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need three doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.<br />
[335011030] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need four doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.<br />
[335011040] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need five doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.<br />
[335011050] As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need six doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[335012000] I see, I see. You have what I asked.<br />
[335012010] All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm.<br />
[335012020] Good work, my compeer.<br />
[335012030] Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[335013000] Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer.<br />
[335013010] Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[335014000] Allow me a little advice, my compeer.<br />
[335014010] Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight.<br />
[335014020] If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures,<br />
[335014030] Then treat them to some dreambrew.<br />
[335014040] Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour...<br />
[335014050] Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue...  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[335015000] Did you forget something?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[335016000] Oh, hello there.<br />
[335016010] Have you brought me some more slumber fog?  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[335017000] You certainly have a taste for spirits.<br />
[335017010] I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[335018000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[335019000] ...<br />
[335019010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[335020000] As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth.<br />
[335020010] And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship.<br />
[335020020] Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[335030000] Ah, good to see you.<br />
[335030010] I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened.<br />
[335030020] So I forced these old bones to weather the journey.<br />
[335030030] Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage?<br />
[335030040] Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh.<br />
[335030050] But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles...  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[335031000] Did you need something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[335032000] Oh it's, good, good to see you.<br />
[335032010] I think I was about to freeze solid.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[335033000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[335034000] ...<br />
[335034010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[335040000] You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.<br />
[335040010] Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.<br />
[335040020] The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.<br />
[335040030] Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling...<br />
[335040040] Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth,<br />
[335040050] each of us has our secrets, my compeer.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[335041000] You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.<br />
[335041010] Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.<br />
[335041020] The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[335050000] Finally, I have found it!<br />
[335050010] St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver.<br />
[335050020] I have partaken of untold secrets.<br />
[335050030] Such that I might aid you, O Lord.<br />
[335050040] So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,<br />
[335050050] Into your dream, the world of your heart.<br />
[335050060] Indeed, I beg you grant my wish,<br />
[335050070] That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[335051000] I have partaken of untold secrets.<br />
[335051010] Such that I might aid you, O Lord.<br />
[335051020] So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,<br />
[335051030] Into your dream, the world of your heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[335060000] ...  </p>
<h3>3351</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[335100000] Oh ho, are you asking me to partake?<br />
[335100010] Well, I haven't got a clue what to think.<br />
[335100020] Is this outright impudence? Simple callousness? Or genuine kindness, I wonder?<br />
[335100030] ...<br />
[335100040] Well, what matters it? I'll take some, regardless.<br />
[335100050] You couldn't possibly fathom the secrets I possess, my compeer.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[335101000] ...  </p>
<h3>3358</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[335800000] ...<br />
[335800010] Have you lost your marbles?<br />
[335800020] You do know I'm merely a beggar.<br />
[335800030] I've nothing left to give.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[335801000] Haven't you Tarnished any respect?<br />
[335801010] For those who came before you.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[335802000] Well, that knocked the wind out of me.<br />
[335802010] The perfect time to try that special reserve…  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[335803000] You base, facile, uncharitable bastard…<br />
[335803010] You're beyond help, my compeer…  </p>
<h3>3359</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[335900000]  <br />
[335900010]  <br />
[335900020]  <br />
[335900030]    </p>
<h3>3370</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[337001000] Welcome, dear guest.<br />
[337001010] After being out there, it must be quite surprising,<br />
[337001020] to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace.<br />
[337001030] The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[337002000] Oh?<br />
[337002010] I didn't notice that you were Tarnished.<br />
[337002020] ...<br />
[337002030] Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way.<br />
[337002040] But you must leave the capital at once.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[337003000] It is for your own good, I assure you.<br />
[337003010] All things have their proper place.<br />
[337003020] We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital.<br />
[337003030] You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.<br />
[337003040] So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.<br />
[337003050] The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.<br />
[337003060] Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.<br />
[337003070] But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!<br />
[337003080] Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,<br />
[337003090] the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!<br />
[337003100] The lesson here is self-evident.<br />
[337003110] The capital is simply not where you belong.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[337004000] You mustn't take it the wrong way.<br />
[337004010] But you must leave the capital at once.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[337010000] Well, what have we here...<br />
[337010010] You hunt Omen, do you?<br />
[337010020] Mm-hmm, yes it appears so...<br />
[337010030] Well, then perhaps we can talk.<br />
[337010040] For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly.<br />
[337010050] Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.<br />
[337010060] And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.<br />
[337010070] The Undercapital is a repository of waste.<br />
[337010080] For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.<br />
[337010090] And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.<br />
[337010100] A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[337011000] Get on with it, then.<br />
[337011010] Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.<br />
[337011020] I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[337020000] Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />
[337020010] Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.<br />
[337020020] I forgive you.<br />
[337020030] We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[337021000] Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />
[337021010] That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[337030000] Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.<br />
[337030010] You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.<br />
[337030020] Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.<br />
[337030030] Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.<br />
[337030040] The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.<br />
[337030050] No, this is above their station...<br />
[337030060] If I explained that this was all my idea,<br />
[337030070] I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.<br />
[337030080] What a wondrous opportunity.<br />
[337030090] That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.<br />
[337030100] Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[337031000] Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.<br />
[337031010] This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.<br />
[337031020] It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[337032000] I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...<br />
[337032010] For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[337033000] Now, I need to get myself ready.<br />
[337033010] If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,<br />
[337033020] I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[337040000] Kill our lord...<br />
[337040010] He is a stain upon all things golden...<br />
[337040020] Kill Morgott, kingly impostor!<br />
[337040030]    </p>
<h3>Millicent [3480]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[348001000] Ah...ahh...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[348002000] Ngh... W-who's there?<br />
[348002010] Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.<br />
[348002020] My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.<br />
[348002030] It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[348003000] If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.<br />
[348003010] My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[348010000] You ask that I stab myself with the needle...<br />
[348010010] To quell the scarlet rot?<br />
[348010020] But...how?<br />
[348010030] ...<br />
[348010040] Never mind. I've decided.<br />
[348010050] I would rather trust you,<br />
[348010060] than simply continue to spoil from within.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[348011000] Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment?<br />
[348011050] Well. That was easier than expected.<br />
[348011060] But...why do I feel so...<br />
[348011070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[348012000] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[348020000] I...hoped to see you again.<br />
[348020010] My apologies, for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you.<br />
[348020020] Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe.<br />
[348020030] Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please.<br />
[348020040] Not that I could ever truly repay you,<br />
[348020050] but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[348021000] I'm considering leaving. On a journey.<br />
[348021010] With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...<br />
[348021020] My destiny...<br />
[348021030] It's all thanks to you.<br />
[348021040] My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[348022000] I'm considering leaving. On a journey.<br />
[348022010] With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...<br />
[348022020] My destiny...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[348025000] Oh, hello again.<br />
[348025010] Something about this place felt familiar to me.<br />
[348025020] So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here.<br />
[348025030] But I've only found emptiness.<br />
[348025040] Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[348026000] Well, never mind that.<br />
[348026010] I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.<br />
[348026020] I must stay strong.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[348030000] Ah. We meet again.<br />
[348030010] In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me.<br />
[348030020] The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met.<br />
[348030030] As such, I've been able to continue my journey.<br />
[348030040] Though rather vexingly,<br />
[348030050] I realise that if I still had my sword arm,<br />
[348030060] I could have aided you in battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[348031000] Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took,<br />
[348031010] after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds.<br />
[348031020] I should like to meet her, this vanished woman.<br />
[348031030] I think she's in the north.<br />
[348031040] In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[348032000] Are you...<br />
[348032010] Giving me this arm?<br />
[348032020] I thank you.<br />
[348032030] I am in your debt, yet again.<br />
[348032040] I think, If the arm serves well enough,<br />
[348032050] It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[348033000] If the arm serves well enough,<br />
[348033010] It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.<br />
[348033020] Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[348035000] Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took.<br />
[348035010] She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[348040000] Ah, we meet yet again.<br />
[348040010] The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.<br />
[348040020] It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.<br />
[348040030] Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.<br />
[348040040] Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[348041000] Ah, we meet yet again.<br />
[348041010] The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.<br />
[348041020] It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.<br />
[348041030] Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.<br />
[348041040] Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[348042000] I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.<br />
[348042010] It is the only way that I can express my thanks.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[348050000] To think we'd meet in such a place...<br />
[348050010] What could your purpose possibly...<br />
[348050020] No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me.<br />
[348050030] Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[348051000] I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.<br />
[348051010] I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.<br />
[348051020] I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.<br />
[348051030] Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found.<br />
[348051040] The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[348052000] I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.<br />
[348052010] I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.<br />
[348052020] I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[348060000] Again we meet.<br />
[348060010] I can only surmise our purposes are aligned.<br />
[348060020] In which case, allow me to explain myself.<br />
[348060030] I am of Malenia's blood.<br />
[348060040] But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot…<br />
[348060050] Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[348061000] There is something I must return to Malenia.<br />
[348061010] The will that was once her own.<br />
[348061020] The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.<br />
[348061030] The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[348062000] There is something I must return to Malenia.<br />
[348062010] The will that was once her own.<br />
[348062020] The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[348070000] Oh, hello.<br />
[348070010] Thank you for lending your hand.<br />
[348070020] Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet.<br />
[348070030] I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.<br />
[348070040] Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[348071000] But this is where things end.<br />
[348071010] I pause to even tell you, but...<br />
[348071020] I took out the needle myself.<br />
[348071030] Tell whoever put you up to this.<br />
[348071040] That if I am to flower into something other than myself,<br />
[348071050] I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[348072000] Please, let me pass alone.<br />
[348072010] The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever.<br />
[348072020] Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh.<br />
[348072030] Curse-laden. Untouchable.<br />
[348072040] I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.  </p>
<h3>3488</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[348800000] Ugh.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[348801000] Is there something wrong?<br />
[348801010] Please, cease this at once.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[348802000] Why are you doing this?<br />
[348802010] Now you've forced my hand.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[348803000] I will not forget what you did for me.<br />
[348803010] But this day marks our farewell.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[348804000] I did not imagine it ending like this.<br />
[348804010] But I will not forget what you have done.<br />
[348804020] Thank...you...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[348805000] Ahh, how could you...<br />
[348805010] Is this your true heart?<br />
[348805020] Was I... was it all...for this?  </p>
<h3>3489</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[348900000]  <br />
[348900100]  <br />
[348900200]    </p>
<h3>Sage Gowry [3490]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[349001000] Oh, a pleasure to see you, a pleasure indeed.<br />
[349001010] I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day, anyway.<br />
[349001020] I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along.<br />
[349001030] A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.<br />
[349001040] Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense.<br />
[349001050] Should you accept…<br />
[349001060] I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[349010000] Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you?<br />
[349010010] I need your help to heal a certain young girl.<br />
[349010020] Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia,<br />
[349010030] resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[349011000] The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure.<br />
[349011010] When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.<br />
[349011020] But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated.<br />
[349011030] For this, you are to find a certain needle.<br />
[349011040] Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds.<br />
[349011050] The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[349012000] First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle.<br />
[349012010] It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia.<br />
[349012020] Then I will tell you, as promised.<br />
[349012030] The secret of the town of Sellia.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[349013000] Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I.<br />
[349013010] Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting.<br />
[349013020] But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be,<br />
[349013030] do come and speak with me again.<br />
[349013040] I'll wait as long as it takes.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[349014000] Ah, changed your mind, have you?<br />
[349014010] If you are willing to undertake my request,<br />
[349014020] I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[349020000] Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle.<br />
[349020010] As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here.<br />
[349020020] Go on, it's yours.<br />
[349020030] Now, let me have a look at the needle.<br />
[349020040] Hmm.<br />
[349020050] Hmmmm.<br />
[349020060] Well, well, this is a marvel indeed.<br />
[349020070] The work of a true artisan…a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.<br />
[349020080] Can you give me some time with this?<br />
[349020090] As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[349021000] I have awaited your return.<br />
[349021010] The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.<br />
[349021020] Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?<br />
[349021030] I will reward you in kind.<br />
[349021040] Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder.<br />
[349021050] Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god.<br />
[349021060] A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[349022000] Do you find it peculiar?<br />
[349022010] That I would show such concern for the girl.<br />
[349022020] Well, I'm the one that found her.<br />
[349022030] A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia.<br />
[349022040] She is one of my dear daughters.<br />
[349022050] But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.<br />
[349022060] I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me.<br />
[349022070] Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.<br />
[349022080] Ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[349023000] Can you give me some time with this?<br />
[349023010] As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[349027000] Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent.<br />
[349027010] She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia.<br />
[349027020] Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[349030000] Thank you kindly.<br />
[349030010] For giving the needle to Millicent.<br />
[349030020] Now she, too, can begin her journey.<br />
[349030030] And stare her fate straight in the eye.<br />
[349030040] You've been a saint, through and through.<br />
[349030050] As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge<br />
[349030060] of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[349031000] Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.<br />
[349031010] Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,<br />
[349031020] but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[349032000] Oh, you noticed, did you?<br />
[349032010] Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.<br />
[349032020] It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.<br />
[349032030] However, she has no need of me, any more.<br />
[349032040] No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.<br />
[349032050] As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...<br />
[349032060] Is to be forgotten.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[349035000] Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help?  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[349036000] Do you...need me for something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[349040000] So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement…<br />
[349040010] This is a wonderful development.<br />
[349040020] Thank you for your kindness.<br />
[349040030] Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential.<br />
[349040040] Like her beautiful mother.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[349041000] The girl, Millicent. She is a bud.<br />
[349041010] Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence.<br />
[349041020] What a wondrous day that will be.<br />
[349041030] In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.<br />
[349041040] She might very well outshine her sisters.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[349050000] Do you have an interest in rot incantations?<br />
[349050010] Then you might like to learn something of the history...<br />
[349050020] of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[349051000] Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.<br />
[349051010] She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.<br />
[349051020] An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.<br />
[349051030] In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,<br />
[349051040] the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.<br />
[349051050] Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.<br />
[349051060] And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[349060000] Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she?<br />
[349060010] The words of a true innocent, the dear girl.<br />
[349060020] Well, perhaps this is just as it should be.<br />
[349060030] Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.<br />
[349060040] This is their fate, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[349070000] <sobbing>  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[349071000] Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there.<br />
[349071010] Welcome. How may I help you?<br />
[349071020] My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[349072000] Oh, it's just…<br />
[349072010] I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and…<br />
[349072020] My eyes began to well...<br />
[349072030] She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.<br />
[349072040] And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.<br />
[349072050] Which is why...<br />
[349072060] If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,<br />
[349072070] I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.<br />
[349072080] It must be done by your hand; no other.<br />
[349072090] Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.<br />
[349072100] Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.<br />
[349072110] When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.<br />
[349072120] As a scarlet valkyrie.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[349073000] Thus, I have a request of the utmost import.<br />
[349073010] I beg you, kill Millicent.<br />
[349073020] Before the girl can meet her sisters.<br />
[349073030] There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.<br />
[349073040] You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.<br />
[349073050] Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.<br />
[349073060] Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie.  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[349074000] You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.<br />
[349074010] The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?<br />
[349074020] I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[349075000] Welcome, welcome. How may I help you?<br />
[349075010] Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters.  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[349076000] When the time is ripe...<br />
[349076010] Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies.<br />
[349076020] <sigh><br />
[349076030] Millicent, my daughter.<br />
[349076040] Why would you take out the needle?<br />
[349076050] You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers.<br />
[349076060] Would you disown us too? As your Mother did?<br />
[349076070] We children of the scarlet rot?  </p>
<h4>Section 78</h4>
<p>[349078000] Millicent...<br />
[349078010] Malenia...<br />
[349078020] Do you detest us, so utterly?  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[349080000] Have you taken the lesson, now?<br />
[349080010] Killing me is but an exercise in futility.<br />
[349080020] All is well, provided you understand.<br />
[349080030] Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?<br />
[349080040] <sobbing><br />
[349080050] O Millicent, my daughter...<br />
[349080060] Who would prune your sapling flesh?<br />
[349080070] Such...such cruel and vulgar violence...<br />
[349080080] <sobbing>  </p>
<h3>3491</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[349101000] Oh, Millicent...<br />
[349101010] My most promising little bud...<br />
[349101020] <sobbing>  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[349110000] Well, well. What have we here?<br />
[349110010] I-is this to toast the girl's departure?<br />
[349110020] How very kind of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[349111000] Well, well. What have we here?<br />
[349111010] Is this to toast the girl's flowering?<br />
[349111020] You've got a good head on your shoulders.<br />
[349111030] How very kind of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[349112000] <sleeping>  </p>
<h3>3498</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[349800000] Owgh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[349801000] Please, enough.<br />
[349801010] There is nothing to be gained by persevering.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[349802000] So, the lesson remains unlearned.<br />
[349802010] Perhaps you've taken one knock to the head too many.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[349803000] We shall meet again, you and I.<br />
[349803010] There are countless pests to choose from.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[349804000] We shall meet again.<br />
[349804010] As many times as it takes. For you to understand.  </p>
<h3>3499</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[349900000]  <br />
[349900010]    </p>
<h3>Scribe Corhyn [3510]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[351001000] Oh, I see you've just arrived.<br />
[351001010] Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.<br />
[351001020] I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers,<br />
[351001030] and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.<br />
[351001040] So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,<br />
[351001050] ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.<br />
[351001060] By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[351002000] You do! Wonderful news.<br />
[351002010] Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.<br />
[351002020] You are something of a rare breed.<br />
[351002030] Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[351003000] Ah, well, that is unfortunate.<br />
[351003010] But no cause for despair.<br />
[351003020] It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time.<br />
[351003030] Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.<br />
[351003040] I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[351004000] What is it?<br />
[351004010] Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[351005000] Ah, I see.<br />
[351005010] Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.<br />
[351005020] I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[351010000] Further study of incantations, is it?<br />
[351010010] I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[351011000] Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.<br />
[351011010] Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[351012000] May the Golden Order shine through you.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[351015000] There's something I should mention to you, as well.<br />
[351015010] I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[351015020] Do you know of the noble Goldmask?<br />
[351015030] Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between,<br />
[351015040] he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace.<br />
[351015050] And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...<br />
[351015060] I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[351020000] Ah, I had been waiting for your return.<br />
[351020010] I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all.<br />
[351020020] As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask.<br />
[351020030] We may not meet again for some time.<br />
[351020040] If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[351021000] Ah, I had been waiting for your return.<br />
[351021010] I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[351021020] I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction.<br />
[351021030] We may not meet again for some time.<br />
[351021040] If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[351030000] Ah, look who we have here.<br />
[351030010] How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold.<br />
[351030020] I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually.<br />
[351030030] And will happily pass it along to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[351035000] I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask.<br />
[351035010] I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree.<br />
[351035020] The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall.<br />
[351035030] Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,<br />
[351035040] How little it is I truly know...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[351036000] Do...do you sport with me!?<br />
[351036010] From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!<br />
[351036020] Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by.<br />
[351036030] Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays.<br />
[351036040] And to you too. My sincerest thanks.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[351037000] I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask.<br />
[351037010] It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[351040000] Ah, we meet yet again.<br />
[351040010] Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,<br />
[351040020] and taken my place by his side, as you can see.<br />
[351040030] Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before.<br />
[351040040] Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[351041000] Further study of incantations, is it?<br />
[351041010] Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[351042000] Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.<br />
[351042010] Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[351043000] May the Golden Order shine through you.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[351045000] The master is always deep in contemplation.<br />
[351045010] While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger.<br />
[351045020] And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom...<br />
[351045030] I know that this, this is my life's calling.<br />
[351045040] The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[351046000] Master! What ever is the matter?<br />
[351046010] Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms!<br />
[351046020] I must be the one to record them!<br />
[351046030] What matters this issue of Radagon, really?<br />
[351046040] The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!<br />
[351046050] Why must these qualms come to you now?<br />
[351046060] We were on the very cusp!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[351047000] Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.<br />
[351047010] I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[351048000] Did you need something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[351049000] Oh, was that you?<br />
[351049010] Yes, the master is still ceased.<br />
[351049020] And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times?  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[351050000] The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.<br />
[351050010] While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.<br />
[351050020] Until he simply ceased.<br />
[351050030] Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.<br />
[351050040] The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...<br />
[351050050] The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...<br />
[351050060] Who exactly was Radagon?<br />
[351050070] The master is stumped.<br />
[351050080] His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.<br />
[351050090] Curse my mediocre mind.<br />
[351050100] The master only has me, and here I fail him...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[351051000] What on earth did you do to the master?<br />
[351051010] Well, not that I'm complaining.<br />
[351051020] Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.<br />
[351051030] I haven't the words to thank you.<br />
[351051040] So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.<br />
[351051050] A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[351052000] To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.<br />
[351052010] Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.<br />
[351052020] How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.<br />
[351052030] Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.<br />
[351052040] Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?<br />
[351052050] ...<br />
[351052060] Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.<br />
[351052070] In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not,<br />
[351052080] I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[351053000] Who exactly was Radagon?<br />
[351053010] The master is stumped.<br />
[351053020] His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.<br />
[351053030] But oh, how important could it really be?<br />
[351053040] The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!<br />
[351053050] Why must these qualms come to you now?<br />
[351053060] We were on the very cusp!  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[351060000] Ah, nice to see you.<br />
[351060010] I can't believe you've come all this way.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[351061000] Do you need...something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[351062000] Ah, nice to see you.<br />
[351062010] Do you need...something else?  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[351065000] I've…been gripped by a terrifying thought.<br />
[351065010] The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...<br />
[351065020] betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.<br />
[351065030] A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.<br />
[351065040] Oh, but how could this be?<br />
[351065050] I dread to even entertain the possibility...<br />
[351065060] but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master.<br />
[351065070] Tell me, have I simply lost my head?<br />
[351065080] Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order,<br />
[351065090] why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[351066000] Oh master, put my mind at ease.<br />
[351066010] Dispel these fearsome thoughts.<br />
[351066020] I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.<br />
[351066030] <sobbing>  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[351067000] What...is this?<br />
[351067010] It will make me forget, you say?<br />
[351067020] So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...<br />
[351067030] Ha...ha ha...<br />
[351067040] Would that I could... Would that I could...<br />
[351067050]    </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[351070000] Oh, it's you.<br />
[351070010] I've finally come to understand.<br />
[351070020] The master was nothing more than a madman.<br />
[351070030] Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,<br />
[351070040] seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!<br />
[351070050] Could there be a more pitiable comedy?<br />
[351070060] Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!<br />
[351070070] Ha...ha ha ha...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[351080000] Master...where did you go?<br />
[351080010] I'm right here. Please, show me.<br />
[351080020] Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus.<br />
[351080030] Let me document the motions...<br />
[351080040] Master...master...<br />
[351080050] Where did you go?  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[351090000] This...is a volume of incantation.<br />
[351090010] It's good to see your enthusiasm.<br />
[351090020] Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands.  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[351091000] That...is a work of heresy.<br />
[351091010] Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.<br />
[351091020] My interests lie solely in the Golden Order.<br />
[351091030] I cannot accept this.  </p>
<h4>Section 92</h4>
<p>[351092000] That...is a work of heresy.<br />
[351092010] Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.<br />
[351092020] ...<br />
[351092030] Very well...I'll take it off your hands.<br />
[351092040] I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith.<br />
[351092050] Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master.  </p>
<h3>3518</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[351800000] Ngh!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[351801000] What are you trying to achieve?<br />
[351801010] Cease that!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[351802000] You've done it now.<br />
[351802010] Faith grants me strength, that I might endure.<br />
[351802020] O Golden Order, shine through me.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[351803000] I pray...<br />
[351803010] That the guidance of grace abandons you.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[351804000] Please don't trouble us again.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[351805000] O guidance...of grace...<br />
[351805010] Why...can't I...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[351806000] O, master...<br />
[351806010] To be ever...at your side...  </p>

<h3>7000</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[700001000] A proper death means returning to the Erdtree.<br />
[700001010] Have patience. Until the time comes...and the roots call to you.<br />
[700001020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[700010000] The mausoleum prowls. Cradling the soulless demigod.<br />
[700010010] O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child.<br />
[700010020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[700020000] O Sapling! Sweet sapling of glorious gold.<br />
[700020010] Has your crystal teardrop ripened?<br />
[700020020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[700030000] Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting place is violated.<br />
[700030010] To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death... Sickening.<br />
[700030020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[700040000] The demi-humans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken...<br />
[700040010] Where are you, Lord Kenneth?<br />
[700040020] The knight...bedeviled by blood.<br />
[700040030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[700050000] Please, help me. I'm of noble blood.<br />
[700050010] If those hideous mongrels eat me, I'll be forever marred...<br />
[700050020] Anything but that, please! Think of the disgrace!<br />
[700050030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[700060000] All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...<br />
[700060010] So, why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?<br />
[700060020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[700070000] ...<br />
[700070010] Maiden, dear maiden, where are you?<br />
[700070020] Please, take my grapes.  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[700080000] ...<br />
[700080010] Ohh, there it is, the tower!<br />
[700080020] Finally, I can return. To our home, bathed in rays of gold!  </p>
<h3>7010</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[701000020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[701001000] This village is done for.<br />
[701001010] Please, even if it's just you, old Albus, hide well and still your breath.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[701010000] ...<br />
[701010010] Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all.<br />
[701010020] Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.<br />
[701010030] We beg of you, incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.<br />
[701010040] Ahh, may chaos take the world!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[701020000] ...<br />
[701020010] Ahh, the puppets...<br />
[701020020] The puppets besiege us...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[701030000] ...<br />
[701030010] Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic.<br />
[701030020] Why shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone?  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[701040000] ...<br />
[701040010] Ahh, Iji, forgive me.<br />
[701040020] These royal grounds were placed in our trust,<br />
[701040030] but we stood no chance.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[701050000] ...<br />
[701050010] O Celestial Globe, transmit to posterity. The wisdom of the moon and stars.<br />
[701050020] And obscure, forever, the transgressions of the princess.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[701060000] ...<br />
[701060010] Lady Ranni, we have long awaited you.<br />
[701060020] I pray for your house's swift revival.<br />
[701060030] May the full moon shine upon Caria.  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[701070000] Come out, one and all, from the darkness underground.<br />
[701070010] And let us offer unto the maiden our eyes.<br />
[701070020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[701080000] Ahh, the poor fellow...gone perfectly mad.<br />
[701080010] Love...revenge...the frenzied flame melts it all away...<br />
[701080020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[701090000] ...<br />
[701090010] It's there, somewhere.<br />
[701090020] Another path, leading back to the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
[701090030] An ancient tunnel.  </p>
<h3>7020</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[702001000] ...<br />
[702001010] Eek... I hear a festive melody...<br />
[702001020] No, no, don't skin me...<br />
[702001030] My hide is filthy, I swear...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[702010000] ...<br />
[702010010] Ohh, Erdtree, great Erdtree.<br />
[702010020] The Golden Order itself, unwavering, stretched to the sky.<br />
[702010030] Confer your guidance. To our Elden Lord.<br />
[702010040] To put this weary world to rights...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[702020000] ...<br />
[702020010] Lord Rykard...<br />
[702020020] If this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring,<br />
[702020030] then I can no longer abide.<br />
[702020040] No one can.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[702030000] ...<br />
[702030010] House Marais is ruined...<br />
[702030020] Just deserts, for falling for that severed harpy.<br />
[702030030] No surprise that guilty cretin took the castle and our storied sword...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[702040000] Eek...! The wretched fools... <br />
[702040010] They'll never find me.<br />
[702040020] Heh heh... I'll survive, I swear it.<br />
[702040030] I'll soon be back at the Volcano Manor.  </p>
<h3>7030</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[703001000] ...<br />
[703001010] Sublime, I tell you.<br />
[703001020] The very first flower of Aeonia bloomed on this very spot.<br />
[703001030] Malenia, may you blossom into a goddess.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[703010000] ...<br />
[703010010] Convene the festival of war.<br />
[703010020] Honor General Radahn, with a warrior's glory.<br />
[703010030] It's in your hands, Sir Jerren...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[703020000] ...<br />
[703020010] Let me see it, if only one last time.<br />
[703020020] Your splendid blade, dancing amongst the scarlet rot.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[703030000] ...<br />
[703030010] I'm dry, dry as a bone...<br />
[703030020] Fool dragon, surrender your strength.<br />
[703030030] Let me feast on your heart.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[703040000] ...<br />
[703040010] It's rotting.<br />
[703040020] Everything, rotting scarlet.<br />
[703040030] The very earth that Caelid rests upon, and Sellia, town of sorcery.<br />
[703040040] The end is nigh, for us all.  </p>
<h3>7040</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[704001000] ...<br />
[704001010] Ohh great sun! Frigid sun of Sol!<br />
[704001020] Surrender yourself to the eclipse!<br />
[704001030] Grant life to the soulless bones!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[704010000] ...<br />
[704010010] Lord Miquella, forgive me.<br />
[704010020] The sun has not been swallowed. Our prayers were lacking.<br />
[704010030] Your comrade remains soulless...<br />
[704010040] I will never set my eyes upon it now...<br />
[704010050] Your divine Haligtree...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[704020000] ...<br />
[704020010] Show me the path, O gentle lights.<br />
[704020020] The promised path to the Haligtree!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[704030000] ...<br />
[704030010] Only...a little further now...<br />
[704030020] Show me the path, O gentle lights...the path to Elphael.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[704040000] ...<br />
[704040010] Mohg, you rotten Omen. Your blood is cursed.<br />
[704040020] Give him back.<br />
[704040030] Give Lord Miquella back!<br />
[704040040] How dare you lay hands on such precious flesh!  </p>
<h3>7050</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[705001000] ...<br />
[705001010] Lord of Blood, your eminence.<br />
[705001020] I beg you, grant me a seat at the table of the dynasty.<br />
[705001030] Long live the Mohgwyn Dynasty.<br />
[705001040] Long live! The Mohgwyn Dynasty!  </p>
<h3>7060</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[706001000] ...<br />
[706001010] Behold. The Erdtree yet stands.<br />
[706001020] Tall and unwavering, mindless of the scorch of the flame of ruin.<br />
[706001030] Hahah, Hahah...<br />
[706001040] Then, we are yet Golden Ones.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[706010000] He is returned! The Lord has returned at long last.<br />
[706010010] Our very first lord, to brandish the Elden Ring once more...<br />
[706010020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[706020000] ...<br />
[706020010] Brave Tarnished. Take the plunge.<br />
[706020020] Of learning, and remembrance.<br />
[706020030] Recall the arts of war. And your warrior's blood.  </p>
<h3>7300</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[730000100] One day, we'll return together.<br />
[730000105] To our home, bathed in rays of gold.<br />
[730000110] There is only one tree, and only its branches.<br />
[730000115] That bathe in true rays of gold.<br />
[730000120] Not the fool Omen King.<br />
[730000125] Nor the rank malformed twins.<br />
[730000130] O, we are the Golden Ones. The true and rightful heirs.<br />
[730000135] Our land's grown old, now ashen, and cold.<br />
[730000140] But look up, the Erdtree glows!<br />
[730000145] Is there still a place for us?<br />
[730000150] In our home, bathed in rays of gold.<br />
[730000155] They will always welcome us.<br />
[730000160] To our home, bathed in rays of gold.  </p>
<h3>7360</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[736000100] Erdtree, O Golden Circle.<br />
[736000110] Grant us the droplets of life,<br />
[736000120] Structure us. Reveal our path.<br />
[736000130] We are your guardians.<br />
[736000140] We swat at flies, snuff out flame,<br />
[736000150] Repel the Omen, and undo Tarnish.<br />
[736000160] Blessed we, at your side, eternal.<br />
[736000170] Blessed we, at your side, on this journey.<br />
[736000180] Serve you we shall, in life, eternal.  </p>

<h3>7430</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[743000100] Agheel, oh, Agheel...<br />
[743000110] Feral flame of Agheel, burn true...<br />
[743000200] Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.<br />
[743000210] We journey on a road so far,<br />
[743000220] Death's fortune's what we seek.<br />
[743000230] Coffin in tow, we'll find a hero<br />
[743000240] And scraps of his great deeds!<br />
[743000250] Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.<br />
[743000260] Who rode along this road before?<br />
[743000270] He did, but won't anymore.<br />
[743000280] Whoah, whoah, whoah, woah.<br />
[743000290] He did, but won't anymore.<br />
[743000300] <Incoherent rambling><br />
[743000310] <Pathetic nonverbal wail that seems to suggest "Stop! Just go away!"><br />
[743000320] <Pathetic nonverbal wail when he suddenly notices a stranger nearby><br />
[743000400] Erdtree, O Golden Circle.<br />
[743000410] Grant us the droplets of life,<br />
[743000420] Structure us. Reveal our path.<br />
[743000430] We are your guardians.<br />
[743000440] We swat at flies, snuff out flame,<br />
[743000450] Repel the Omen, and undo Tarnish.<br />
[743000460] Blessed we, at your side, eternal.<br />
[743000470] Blessed we, at your side, on this journey.<br />
[743000480] Serve you we shall, in life, eternal.  </p>
<h3>7434</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[743400100] <Incoherent rambling. Very quiet, but sounds acutely irritated and on the verge of breaking out in madness.><br />
[743400110] <The wings of a fly reverberate inside his headpiece, and it becomes too much to tolerate - he makes this sound as his psyche snaps.>  </p>
<h3>7438</h3>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[743820100] <Sound of swinging a giant pickaxe. A slow swing with much weight. Several versions.><br />
[743820110] <A shout as he holds his pickaxe high, mustering strength. Several versions.><br />
[743820120] <Loud snoring as he sleeps.>  </p>
<h3>7460</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[746000100] <A roar as he releases the all the strength that he was holding inside. A growly warcry.><br />
[746000110] <He screams to intimidate his foe as he draws his sword.><br />
[746000120] <A shout as he holds his sword high, mustering strength: whoaahhh! Etc.><br />
[746000130] <Feeling bored and exhausted, his jaw drops open and this sound emanates from deep down his throat. It is a low bellowing that can be heard echoing around the vicinity.><br />
[746000140] <Loud snoring as he sleeps.>  </p>
<h3>7469</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[746900100] Blessed Erdtree...<br />
[746900110] O hallowed Runes...<br />
[746900200] <Invigorating shouts for repeated rapier thrusts. Sharply enunciated, suggesting proper training.>  </p>
<h3>Merchant Kalé [8000]</h3>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[800001000] You're a Tarnished, I can see it.<br />
[800001010] And I can also see...<br />
[800001020] That you're not after my throat.<br />
[800001030] Then why not purchase a little something?<br />
[800001040] I am Kalé. Purveyor of fine goods.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[800002000] What is it? Still going to purchase something?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[800003000] Wait, weren't you...?<br />
[800003010] Well, you're back. Care to buy something?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[800004000] Ah, it's you again.<br />
[800004010] Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[800005000] Good-bye for now.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[800006000] Good-bye. Nice to do business.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[800007000] I am of a nomadic people.<br />
[800007010] Selling wares as I travel.<br />
[800007020] The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring.<br />
[800007030] It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely.<br />
[800007040] Let's say you're a very welcome customer.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[800008000] You know, if you can spare the runes,<br />
[800008010] you should buy yourself a crafting kit.<br />
[800008020] A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own.<br />
[800008030] Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration.<br />
[800008040] The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut.<br />
[800008050] But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[800009000] I'm glad you took my warning to heart.<br />
[800009010] You've made an excellent choice.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[800010000] There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands.<br />
[800010010] If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you?<br />
[800010020] My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold.<br />
[800010030] Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.<br />
[800010040] But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.<br />
[800010050] I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts.<br />
[800010060] Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[800011000] I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you.<br />
[800011010]  I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time.<br />
[800011020] My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason...<br />
[800011030] But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[800012000] Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but...<br />
[800012010] See that no harm comes to my kin.<br />
[800012020] We have a saying, we wanderers.<br />
[800012030] Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing.<br />
[800012040] But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy.<br />
[800012050] That is our code, so to speak.<br />
[800012060] Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[800013000] Ah, by the way...<br />
[800013010] Have you heard of the Great Caravan?  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[800014000] ...I see, more's the pity.<br />
[800014010] Well, even we had a place to call home, once.</p>
<p>[800014020] The Great Caravan, they called it… but it's been lost to us for ages.<br />
[800014030] I've been searching for it as long as I can remember.<br />
[800014040] And with a name like that,<br />
[800014050] You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[800015000] The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...<br />
[800015010] I suppose he must still be skulking about...<br />
[800015020] Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself?<br />
[800015030] Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source.<br />
[800015040] Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear.<br />
[800015050] I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[800016000] Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet.<br />
[800016010] If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[800017000] Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you?<br />
[800017010] Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction.<br />
[800017020] He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg.<br />
[800017030] I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[800030000] Ah, good to see you.<br />
[800030010] I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.<br />
[800030020] Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.<br />
[800030030] A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything?  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[800031000] We meet again, I see.<br />
[800031010] It's me, Kalé.<br />
[800031020] Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.<br />
[800031030] Right then. Care to purchase anything?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[800032000] Have you seen a crow around here by any chance?<br />
[800032010] You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw?<br />
[800032020] Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question.<br />
[800032030] I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[800033000] My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.<br />
[800033010] And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[800034000] So, about the letter you brought me...<br />
[800034010] It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.<br />
[800034020] And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.<br />
[800034030] This could be my chance to get close to it.<br />
[800034040] Thanks to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[800035000] Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.<br />
[800035010] Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.<br />
[800035020] With any luck, I'll see you there, eh.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[800036000] I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...<br />
[800036010] And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...<br />
[800036020] But there's something I need to know.<br />
[800036030] My roots.<br />
[800036040] I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[800050000] Ah, good to see you.<br />
[800050010] I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.<br />
[800050020] The shop is all set up.<br />
[800050030] A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[800051000] Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...<br />
[800051010] I think it's pointing underneath the capital.<br />
[800051020] I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.<br />
[800051030] But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.<br />
[800051040] Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.<br />
[800051050] I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[800052000] Where...did you find this letter?  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[800053000] I can't imagine how it ended up there...<br />
[800053010] But the well might just lead under the capital.<br />
[800053020] To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.<br />
[800053030] Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...<br />
[800053040] But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.<br />
[800053050] Once again, I find myself in your debt.<br />
[800053060] Take this, as a token of my appreciation.<br />
[800053070] It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.<br />
[800053080] I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.<br />
[800053090] Who knows what wonders there might be to trade?  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[800054000] Ah, you, is it...<br />
[800054010] Did you see? What they did to my ancestors?<br />
[800054020] The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves.<br />
[800054030] Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.<br />
[800054040] They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?<br />
[800054050] Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! <br />
[800054060] The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.<br />
[800054070] But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...<br />
[800054080] I'll never forgive any of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[800055000] I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.<br />
[800055010] And...I think it's time we parted ways.<br />
[800055020] Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord.<br />
[800055030] I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[800056000] I should apologise to you.<br />
[800056010] It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess.<br />
[800056020] I'm sorry.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[800057000] I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.<br />
[800057010] I think it's time we parted ways.  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[800058000] Wait, what's that?<br />
[800058010] That burn...<br />
[800058020] Your eyes...<br />
[800058030] You've inherited the flame of frenzy!<br />
[800058040] Oh, that's it... That's what I need...<br />
[800058050] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.<br />
[800058060] The yellow flame of chaos...  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[800059000] Oh, that's it... That's what I need...<br />
[800059010] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.<br />
[800059020] The yellow flame of chaos...  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[800070000] O Three Fingers, throw wide the door.<br />
[800070010] Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos.<br />
[800070020] A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.<br />
[800070030] May chaos take the world.<br />
[800070040] May chaos take the world.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[800071000] The frenzied flame...burned me...<br />
[800071010] I was not... a suitable home.<br />
[800071020] Unknown warrior...<br />
[800071030] You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss...<br />
[800071040] Tell the one... Who will become Lord...<br />
[800071050] Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door.<br />
[800071060] Divest yourself of everything...<br />
[800071070] And pray to the Lord...<br />
[800071080] To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.<br />
[800071090] May chaos...take the world.<br />
[800071100] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[800072000] The frenzied flame...burned me...<br />
[800072010] I was not... a suitable home.<br />
[800072020] Dear Lord, Lord of Chaos...<br />
[800072030] Melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.<br />
[800072040] May chaos...take the world.<br />
[800072050] ...  </p>
