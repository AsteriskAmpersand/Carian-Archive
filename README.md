<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a compilation of all the text files in Elden Ring already unpacked and converted to a readable format. Additionally all of the text files are aggregated into a single one with clearly marked sections and file pairs with Title-Descriptions already parsed. It does not accoutn for mapping text to characters or items or any ingame information. This is merely a more convvenient way of searching text within the game.

This is specially convenient for finding dialogue entries and also item descriptions without having to visit wikis all the time.
You can find the master dump in preview form here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsteriskAmpersand/Carian-Archive/main/Master.html
